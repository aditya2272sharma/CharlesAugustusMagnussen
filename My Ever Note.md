Business Adventure Book Review

The book captures "Hysteria" and "Hubris".

On 1962, May 28th: Dow Jones Industrial Average came down crashing 34.95 percents and it took the tickers 4 hours to update. The longest previous delay was just 21 minutes.

The power of mutual funds to magify a market decline had never been seriously tested.
23 billion dollars in equity were about to be put on the market.
If that kind of money were to be put on the equity market today[2020], it would cause a crash that would make black tuesday seem like a stumble.

The black tuesday was followed by a roaring soaring wednesday when AT&T's shares rose to 98 & 100 dollars eventually and that vote of confidence helped restore the faith & 47 million transcations to happened on Wednesday. 75% of losses had been recouperated in a single day.

This tale is a testament to human nature - the irrationality & herd mentality, and the dangers associated with human nature.

Helvetica Scenario
3 minutes

The Helvetica Scenario is a thought experiment in subatomic physics that originated in universities on the planet Terra, but the experiment is very popular amongst scholars at Enigma University on Katia.

It has to do with the atomic structure of the element calcium; while it tends to be a very stable element, the nucleus of a calcium atom can be removed using quantum superposition, leaving the electron shell "free". While this would cause the collapse of most shells instantly, the shell of a calcium atom can sustain itself for a full second or two after its nucleus has been removed.

Various attempts to use either the liberated electron shell or nucleus for various tasks have been attempted over the centuries (first in 1634), but all of them have ended in failure. The most tragic of these is when a liberated calcium nucleus interacts with other biological compounds in living tissue, resulting in sudden chemical reactions.

The most catastrophic biological change was theorized (and later simulated) by Professor Maxwell Haas of the University of Bern, in the Terran state of Switzerland. Professor Haas was able to show, using computer simulations, a chain reaction brought about by quantum superposition of a calcium nucleus into fatty skin tissue on humanoid creatures. A very fast mutation began, resulting in cellular growth which caused the skin to grow over all open orifices on the skin's surface.

Shortly after the computer simulations were verified by interstellar agencies, the experiment was attempted on a laboratory mouse. The chain reaction did in fact begin, but the animal's heart failed before the experiment could be completed, with scientists theorizing that the shock of having its body change so quickly overloaded it.

The threat of this sort of thing ever happening in nature, or as the result of an accident, or the result of a very sophisticated terrorist attack, has led to it being very well-documented, even though it has yet to occur in any of the above situations. The entire experiment was published in a highly publicized research paper called "The Helvetica Scenario: Quantum Calcic Superposition and Dangerous Mutation". The name "Helvetica Scenario" was picked from the old Latin name for Switzerland, Helvetia, since the entire experiment was spearheaded by scientists from that region. The report was groundbreaking, insofar as it showed the dangers of superposition, thus leading to the strict regulation of such quantum devices.


Definition: https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=the%20helvetica%20scenario
Derived from an experiment (carried out in Switzerland, aka Helvetica) where the nucleus of a calcium molecule in skin was removed, leaving a temporarily stable electron/proton shell, causing a mutation that made the skin grow over all the openings in the skin. The helvetica scenario is a nightmare scenario that occurrs when this technique of removing the calcium nucleus- called quantum superpositioning- is used irresponsibly to harm people.
Political advisors feared that the country would resort to biological weapons, causing something like the helvetica scenario to happen.

Acute Paraphimosis - What You Need to Know
https://www.drugs.com/cg/acute-paraphimosis.html
drugs.com | 5-6 minutes

This material must not be used for commercial purposes, or in any hospital or medical facility. Failure to comply may result in legal action.
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:
What is acute paraphimosis?

Acute paraphimosis is abnormal tightness of the foreskin when it is pulled back. The foreskin is the skin that covers the head (glans) of the penis. Usually, the foreskin can be pulled back onto the penis and uncover the glans. Acute paraphimosis prevents your foreskin from being pulled back.
What causes acute paraphimosis?

Any activity or procedure that causes the foreskin to be pulled back can cause paraphimosis. The foreskin may be pulled back when you clean the glans, or during sexual activity.
What increases my risk for cute paraphimosis?

    Being born with a tight opening of the foreskin
    Poor hygeine
    Infection
    Scarring of the penis caused by injury

What are the signs and symptoms of acute paraphimosis?

    Swollen glans and shaft
    Bluish or dark glans
    Pain in your penis
    Pain when you urinate, or problems urinating

How is acute paraphimosis diagnosed?

Your healthcare provider will ask about your symptoms and examine you. Tell the provider when your symptoms started and how long you have had them. Also tell the provider if you have had an infection or injury to your penis, or used a catheter.
How is acute paraphimosis treated?

Acute paraphimosis may go away on its own. The swelling in your penis should decrease after your foreskin has returned to its normal position. You may need the following treatments if your foreskin does not return to its normal position:

    Medicines may help decrease pain or swelling.
    An ice pack may be placed on the foreskin and glans for 5 to 10 minutes to decrease inflammation.
    Tight pressure may be needed for a short period of time. This will help decrease inflammation. Healthcare providers may wrap your penis with a bandage for 5 to 10 minutes. A bandage with numbing medicine may be used.
    Procedures may be needed to move your foreskin back into position over the glans. Another procedure may be needed to decrease severe swelling.
    Surgery may be needed if other treatments do not work. During surgery, the foreskin is placed in the right position. pressure and swelling are relieved. You may need a circumcision after this procedure because cutting the foreskin will change how your penis looks.

How can I manage my acute paraphimosis?

    Do not have sex until your healthcare provider says it is okay. Do not have any sexual activity for 7 to 10 days, to allow the penis to heal. Sexual activity includes intercourse and masturbation. Ask when you can go back to your usual sexual activities.
    Keep your penis clean. Clean your penis every day by removing the smegma around your glans. Ask for more information about foreskin care.
    Gently move your foreskin back to the normal position. Every time your foreskin is pulled back, make sure it returns to its original position. The foreskin must always cover the glans. Do not force the foreskin back over the glans. Force can cause scars to form on the penis.
    Do not use penile rings. Penile rings can cause swelling and infection.

When should I seek immediate care?

    You have sudden pain or swelling in your penis.
    You lose feeling in your penis.
    You have an open wound on your penis.

When should I contact my healthcare provider?

    Your signs and symptoms return or worsen.
    You have pain during sexual activities.
    You have questions or concerns about your condition or care.

Trick of the Trade: Paraphimosis - Pour Some Sugar On Me

Jonathan Fu, MD
3 minutes

Paraphimosis occurs when a retracted foreskin can’t be reduced back over the glans of the penis. Risk factors for paraphimosis include scarring, vigorous sexual activity, chronic balanoposthitis, and forgetting to replace the foreskin after catheterization or manipulation.

Paraphimosis can be a urological emergency as the tight ring formed by the foreskin can cause ischemia to the tip of the penis and eventually gangrene. Timely reduction is of high importance. Treatment involves gentle compression of the glans and gradual manual foreskin retraction.1 Unfortunately, as time goes on, more swelling occurs making traditional reduction techniques more difficult.
Trick of the Trade

Sugar solution for non-reducible paraphimosis

    Mix 50 mL of 50% dextrose solution with 2% lidocaine jelly (a.k.a. Urojet®).
    Place a gauze into the solution.
    Place soaked gauze on the glans of penis.
    Cover with condom or condom foley.
    Wait 1 hour.
    Reduce the paraphimosis.

The high solute concentration of the sugar water pulls the water from the swollen tissue while lidocaine provides topical analgesia. This technique has been described on ALiEM for a case of rectal prolapse and in a 1998 case report.2
Discussion

This may be an easy and cost-effective means of reducing a paraphimosis in the emergency department. The downside is that the treatment requires at least an hour for the swelling to come down. In a letter describing this technique, Dr. Coutts writes his recipe: “a degree of patience on behalf of the surgeon and patient.”3 This trick of the trade worked for our patient who was able to avoid more invasive procedures like a dorsal penile block and a dorsal slit incision.

https://www.healthline.com/health/smegma
Smegma is a buildup of dead skin cells, oil, and other fluids on the tip of the penis or in the folds of the vagina. The buildup can grow over time, and if it’s not taken care of, it can lead to painful side effects. 
Smegma is a secretion of the oil glands around the genitals. For men, smegma often appears under the foreskin of the penis. In women, it’s most likely to appear between the folds of the vagina’s labia or around the clitoral hood
Smegma has several distinct characteristics:

    • thick, cheese-like consistency
    • white in color (can be darker depending on natural skin tone)
    • unpleasant smell

Developing smegma doesn’t mean you have a sexually transmitted infection or any type of infection. Instead, smegma for both men and women is affected by personal hygiene.

The fluids in smegma are released naturally by your body every day. They help lubricate your genitalia and keep the skin from feeling dry or itchy. If these fluids aren’t washed away regularly, they can start to build up.

Irregularly washing or not washing your genitalia well can cause the fluids to accumulate and harden. It’s important you wash your penis or vagina regularly in order to avoid this buildup.

Smegma is most common in uncircumcised males. The intact foreskin can trap bacteria and fluids, and that makes it easier for smegma to build up.

Because of the high rate of circumcision in the United States, women in the United States are more likely to develop smegma than men.

Smegma is not dangerous. Previous research indicated smegma might lead to penile cancer or cervical cancer, but more conclusive research has determined there is no relationship between smegma and cancer.

Smegma also rarely causes serious complications. If the buildup is not removed or treated, the smegma can become quite hard. This may cause the foreskin to stick to the penis, which can become painful.

In addition, smegma buildup and hardening can cause irritation, redness, swelling, and inflammation on the penis. This can lead to a condition called balanitis.

In women, the buildup may cause the clitoral hood to stick to the clitoral shaft. This can be uncomfortable or even painful.

The best way to treat smegma is to wash your genitalia. Following these instructions can help you eliminate any smegma buildup.

If you’re uncircumcised, gently pull back the foreskin. If you’re female, pull apart your vaginal folds with your first two fingers.

Use mild soap and warm water to wash beneath the foreskin or in and around the labia. Avoid using perfumed or highly-scented soaps. These products may irritate the sensitive skin. If you notice irritation associated with the use of soap, try using only warm water.

Rinse the penis or vagina thoroughly, and dry well.

For men, pull the foreskin back over the tip of the penis. Be careful to not irritate your penis by using sharp devices or products like cotton swabs to clean the head of your penis.

Repeat this cleaning procedure daily until the smegma disappears. Learn 7 tips for getting rid of vaginal odor.

If the buildup doesn’t clear up or if it grows worse and you develop new symptoms, contact your doctor. Also, contact your doctor if cleaning your genitalia doesn’t eliminate the thick fluid buildup. What you think is smegma may actually be symptoms of an infection or another condition.

The best way to prevent smegma is the same as treating it: wash well.

Both men and women should wash their genitalia well at least twice a week. This includes using mild soap and warm water to wash the areas around the penis and vagina. Rinse well to prevent irritation from the soap.

During every shower, a quick wash and rinse can help prevent buildup. This is especially true if your job makes you sweat a lot, or if you do a lot of sweat-inducing workouts.

Smegma is rarely a serious condition. If you think you have smegma on your penis or in your vaginal folds, try thoroughly washing your genitalia for a few days.

If after a week the substances remain, you should consider making an appointment with your doctor. The symptoms you’re experiencing may be the result of an infection, and this will likely require additional treatment.

Joe Rogan Experience
Interview with Raghunath Cappo

What do these spiritual paths have in common? We train ourselves to find the differences in all of them, and the vedic teaching says - Don't you understand? You should be able to walk into a Mosque, into a church, into a synagogue and say, "How nice!! These people are trying to connect". And not that, "We got to win these people over to our team". Because they're all an illusion and they're all going to hell. Forever. Everyone's on a type of path and I appreciate them trying to surrender and the only that's going to get in their way because people say things like this all the time "Yeah! It's religion that caused all the problems in this world". It's not religion. It's the ego that goes with joining a particular Church, Synagogue, Ashram etcetera that 'We have it our way and every body else, they are a problem and we got to fix it'. That's waht gets in the way. Because you can say materialism causes a lot of problems as well in the world. So, I do think, "Ego" is sneaky - it will sneak into your diet, and it'll sneak into your 'God', it'll sneak in and that's why there's an appreciation instead of a condemnation that the people are different than us.

The Wolf of Wall Street
Jordan Belfort

Belfort was born '70s to parents in Bronx area, New York who were both Accountants by profession
Bronx was marred with problems like gang wars and other crimes
To go away from the criminality, they moved to the less expensive and much quieter Bay Side.
He had terrible panic attacks and slept very little.
He had developed a complex about his roots because he was Jewish & he was ashamed of it because
- Middle class protestants held more power (the people living in the smart neighborhood, they were called WASPS).
- He was a little plump Jewish kid and wanted to fit in among the tall, blonde and slim
- He also wanted to be rich
- Because he was from a modest background, he had to work to get pocket money.

In summer of 1979, when the heat wave struck New York, he bought an ice box, sold ice on the parks and beaches and he also convinced others to sell for him and this is how he made 20,000 dollars from an original 10 dollar investment.
He used that money to fund his college education.
He enrolled in Baltimore which was a 3hr drive away from his home.
Baltimore college of Dental Surgery.
But someone told him that the golden age of Dental Surgery and getting rich out of it are over.
So, he left.
In 1983, he started working as a sales man in New York.
He drove around the city selling meat and sea food.
He broke all the sales records. He was the best in the company.
He left the company to establish his own company, grew from 1 truck to 26 trucks in a matter of some months.
He bought a Porsche in 1983 to show off & come out of his inferiority complex.
He had found a loophole - You don't have to pay dealers immediately after purchase.
He left invoices unpaid and his bankers began harassing him for it & eventually, he filed for bankruptcy.

1987: Jordan was 24 when he joined Wall Street.

5th Avenue in Manhattan: LF Rothschild.
After joining the boiler room, working as a connector, talking to potential investors (buyers) for about 7 months, in September 1987, Belfort got his Trader's license. But in October 1987, the stock market fell 22% in one day and he lost job.
It was hard for Belfort and he did not want to start all over again.
He found a broker's job some distance away from Manhattan, in a company that sold penny stocks.
In the first month working at the center, he made 38,000 dollars, and 70,000 the next month.
They used to sell these penny stocks to gullible pensioners who'd thought that they've hit the jackpot because the stocks will get sky high in prices in some time.
In the first year, he made 500.000 dollars in total.

Enter Danny Porosh and creation of Staratton Oakmont.
The name was strategically chosen, to give them an air of respectability.
They began selling the same stocks from small companies.
But they devleoped a brilliant idea - they approached millionaires who'd invest large sums of money.
He prepared a handbook - The straight line persuasion system, which anticipated the responses of the potential clients.
1990: After just 1 year in Long Island, the company, Stratton Oakmont moved to large premises, the [1979 Markus Avenue]
Staet Prosecutor Joel Cohen says, the reason why Stratton Oakmont was set up in Long Island, isntead of Manhattan, is because it made it easy for them to hire young 18-20 year old people who were eager to disrupt and who could easily be moulded by the unusual sales strategy Belfort had developed. They couldn't have hired that kind of people in Manhattan, he adds. Some were college graduates & some where high school graduates. Ideally, in United States, one is required to have a Series 7 Broker Dealer License. It isn't a very difficult exam, but many of them had failed it several times. So, many had hired people to take their tests for them in their name.
Belfort called his employees Stratonians, being an excellent orator, he'd address his employees every morning with a pumped up speech that'll leave the employees in jubilation. He was like a 'cult leader'.
Cocaine & Mandrax(Methaqualone/Quaalude/Sopor) - became the norm, which kept them elated and hypersensitive.
Dealers even delivered to employees in their offices.
Dr Alden Cass, Psychologist, says, a lot of brokers who were using drugs were doing it to kill the pain and the guilt & clear their conscience for misleading investors.
Debauchery[excessive indulgence in sex, alcohol, or drugs.] - Ansari says, they used to have a hooker Tuesday.
The stock market parties were extravagent & incredibly debauched.
Jordan Belfort pamperd his employees with a lot of boozy parties.
The final piece to complete his "IMAGE" was his wife, Nadine, a British Model.
He bought the house which was previously owned by the president of NYSE, Brookville, the super smart neighborhood of Long Island.
"Steaks, Stocks - What's the difference" - The title was quite ironic considering Belfort was a meat salesman in the past.
Belfort's company targetted people living outside New York, gullible, easily influenced, without connections to the outer world.
Pump & Dump strategy:
- "Lets put lipstick on this pig" strategy
- Steve Madden, 1993: Belfort wanted to own 50% stakes in the company but per SEC regulations, he wasn't allowed that kind of ownership. So, he set up front-companies to escape the attention of SEC.
- When the stock exchange opened, Stratton Oakmont bought large quanitities of Steve Madden stocks at $5 via his front companies. The stock price shot up & Jordan had succeeded in making it rise up artificially to $18 & then he told all his traders to sell. In 10 minutes, he had pocketed 20 million dollars. He repeated this illegal operation more than once.
- Stratton Oakmont took public more than 34-35 companies, most  of which, the fundamental idea behind the company wasn't very good. What the company would do - the idea didn't matter much to Belfort.
- The people who buy stocks a little late, they become the primary losers. Because, the stock prices plummet immediately.
- Gregory Coleman was 30 when he investigated Belfort [1992-1994] and it took him 2 years to investigate Belfort & take his case to SEC.
- Belfort had to pay a $2 million fine and he had to lose his trader's license. But he continued to receive an astronomical salary of $1 million a month.
- But then he made an error - To avoid taxation, he arranged a large proportion of his income, he quietly sent money to Switzerland.
- In 1998, he was arrested and charged with Fraud and Money Laundering.

Misconceptions of meritocracy at core of old open-wounds now exposed by the pandemic
==================================
While the infant trying to wake up her dead mom or a sleeping child being dragged on a suitcase may remain imprinted as the political image of this pandemic, for me the most evocative news about of our economic failure is of a Bihari migrant selling off his last meagre wealth (goat) to buy a ticket back home only to find it cancelled and Indigo employees trying to help him out. When you have a society with extreme inequality, you know you will reach such dead-end that even the rich cannot have more headroom to grow.

That is the enduring theme of Thomas Piketty's new book on inequality: Capital and Ideology. It is highly readable and available on Audible and covers India pretty extensively unlike his earlier books. There are also a series of Powerpoint charts available based on this book (Check this master pdf & click on each lecture to download the pdf slides: http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/PikettyNYU2020Syllabus.pdf)

The key messages in this talk:

A. Culture or social process is not the cause of high inequality as much as political and economic decisions taken by society. For example, Sweden is touted as an example of a society with high demand for equality though it was one of the most unequal countries in early part of 20th century

B. His book is optimistic and much prescription for a better future. He is optimistic the era of Reagonomics and Thatcheronomics are coming to an end. One idea he takes from Sweden and Germany is the need for 50:50 representation of workers in board of companies. This has ameliorate effect on the longevity of companies as well as on equity in society.

C. He blames the rise of inequality to the assumption on meritocracy (He quotes a 1958 book: The rise of Meritocracy by Micheal Young). That the rich have slogged their ass off and so deserve the private property they own. However, high inequality (eg. Bottom half in US owns 2% wealth with top 10% owns 60-70%) erodes the system of equal opportunities. This also leads to explanation around lack of public education and healthcare (thr pandemic exposes this open wound very obviously) thereby stifling mobility of people across generations.

D. He gives examples of Russia and China where the fig leaf that traditional democracies offer is also missing. Both these countries hardly offer progressive tax rates. Income tax rates are flat across income groups and inheritance tax is also zero (much like ours). This perpetuates the culture of political dynasties (much like ours except that power usurpers hang a few obviously ones to perpetuate their own).

Why do programmers prefer to use hexadecimal?

http://www.linfo.org/hexadecimal.html
Hexadecimal Definition


Why do programmers prefer to use hexadecimal?
The hexadecimal system is commonly used by programmers to describe locations in memory because it can represent every byte (i.e., eight bits) as two consecutive hexadecimal digits instead of the eight digits that would be required by binary (i.e., base 2) numbers and the three digits that would be required with decimal

Soubhagya laxmi Kar. She is a true cancerian (zodiac) like me. A very family oriented person while at the same time loves to indulge in other fun activities like travelling new places, dancing to the music, drinking with her besties, going for late night long walks/ drives, loves trying new things etc. Her first marriage didn't work for her as she married into a family who had  very conservative mind set, it lasted for less than 6 months. She is an independent woman, cares for her loved ones and can move mountains for them. The little things in life matters a lot to her.
She knows how to stay strong in the face of adversity, mentally mature but a child at heart.. that's how she is with her closed ones. If you are among those zodiac signs who are extremely compatible with cancers, you may fall in love with her after getting to know her.
She wants to settle down happily, doesn't want to rush into any thing due to which she suffered in her last marriage. 
As far as I know her, she will be happy with a man who can love her without making her change her personality or inherent traits. She would like some one who would like to go on the weekends, plan trips on long holidays, handles her with care, mentally mature, responsible and respects elders.  
To know more, you need to talk to her.

The Body, The Mind and The Soul
======================================
Guru: Your body is an accumulation of your diet, your activities. The way how your body, or your appearance is right now has actually been a culmination of years and years of consumption of food, exercise, physical activities. What you see as 'my mind' is similarly an accumulation of impressions over years. Personality is an acquired thing [add explanation here 5:28]. There has to be something superior, something more meaningful existing prior to this to comandeer your body to consume certain kind of diet, do certain kind of exercise or create certain kind of experience, isn't it?  

Scientist: Houstan Texas is an accumulation of roadways and buildings. If you deconstruct and take everything out, we wouldn't be able to say that there was a Houstan here.

Guru: But your body isn't a piece of geography, is it?

Scientist: No, but I may be exactly that - A physical being. I'll tell you from my perspective why that seems like a possibility. It's because we are across the street from the world's largest Medical Center and everyday thousands of people there whose geography is changing because of Alzheimer's or stroke, or tumor or traumatic brain injury. And it also changes who they are. It doesn't seem like there's something fundamental that outlasts damage to the tissue.

Guru: Human expressions can change in a lot of ways. People can have a psychotic break or depression or harmonal imbalance. It would mean that you, as a consciousness, are not able to take full control of your body and mind. Because, would you create depression or psychosis if you could command your body to do certain things? No. You'd rather create something beautiful.

Scientist: True! We certainly would. But that's only if there existed a "separate you", that could gain control. The issue here is - If I lose a certain chunk of tissue, say a finger, I'll still be me, but say, if I lose brain tissue of the same size, I can be someone completely different.  

XXXXX

Guru: Your body isn't you. Your hand isn't you. You can call it my chair because I have been sitting on it whole day, but I can't call that it is me. Human beings have evolved & kind-of deviated from rest of the animals in terms of intellect, such that, we are no longer a slave of our instinctual drives. We have developed consciousness, which enables us to detach ourselves from the basic animal instincts we have. We have chosen to identify ourselves with our bodies just for the sake of simplicity, identification, convention etcetera. The consciousness, which is different from your body is actually meant for exploration. In the course of our living, we have tangled our consciousness, and hence, our indentity with nationality, religion, race, creed or family, and even gender. When there's a war, people think it is better to identify themselves with their nationality. When it comes to deciding which toilet to go into, we decide it by identifying ourselves with our gender. This form of identificaiton is a social convention, a social requirement. Any form of identity limits you. It takes the possibility of the fundamental possibility of what life can be.



Scientist: We have this sort of, "Brain Plasticity", where we absorb what's coming in and that's how we become what we are - an accumulation of all these perceptions, impressions. There is also the case where we come to the table with some pre-programming in our DNA.


Guru: Technology is, unfortunately, a fallout. A fallout of science. Nobody would fund science if it doesn't spin out technology. Science is about Human curiosity and humans want to know, even if that isn't useful.

Technology is all based around usefulness. And therefore, Technology has a shelf life - What's useful today, may not be tomorrow, or may have destructive effects.

It is difficult to say how i am ;) , but yes i am loving for my all siblings , childish for all kids at home , Responsible and caring for my elders , joyful for my close friends.

Female labour-force participation in India declined from 34 pc in 2006 to 24.8 pc in 2020: Study
business-standard.com
Press Trust of India
First Published: Fri, March 06 2020. 19:54 IST 
https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/female-labour-force-participation-in-india-declined-from-34-pc-in-2006-to-24-8-pc-in-2020-study-120030601403_1.html?fbclid=IwAR04ZUNzPCECo5_6e61ZV3CMtfyH_7b265h6yjpeOki6gE2PDuCgjyZmeD8

Female labour-force participation in India has declined from 34 per cent in 2006 to 24.8 per cent in 2020.

According to the UNGC (United Nations Global Compact) India study, India is the only country among the 153 surveyed countries where the economic gender gap is larger than the political gap.

- The female labour-force participation in India has declined from 34 per cent in 2006 to 24.8 per cent in 2020.
- Raising women's participation in the labour force to the same level as men can boost India's GDP by 27 per cent.

Reasons:
- Gender stereotypes and lack of infrastructure has traditionally sidelined women from core manufacturing functions. As a result, not many are able to reach leadership roles. [Criticism: Doesn't mention other roles]

Companies need to ensure policies and procedures are made to adapt to various life changes in their employees, including maternity, changing care needs, dual career couples and continuity, the study said.

"Globally, 38.7 per cent of employed women are working in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, but only 13.8 per cent of landholders are women," it said.

It is the need of the hour that public policy and corporate policies incorporate various gender related barriers in India to ensure effective solutions, according to the study.

"Gender mainstreaming goes beyond developing separate women's projects within work programmes or women's components within existing activities in the work programmes. It requires attention to gender perspectives as an integral part of all activities across all programmes," it said.

This involves putting gender perspectives as the central frame of thought to all policy development, research, advocacy, development, implementation and monitoring of norms and standards and planning, implementation and monitoring of projects, it added.

How you cope with sudden unemployment - The Morning Context
https://themorningcontext.com/how-you-cope-with-sudden-unemployment/
Day after day passes, the world and the country caring about little other than the coronavirus numbers. You tire of sitting in your shorts and imbibing a jumble of news, work emails, Zoom calls and social media, even as conversations in the company, the industry and the economy at large turn increasingly worried.


The MakeMyTrip group of travel websites announces pay cuts, with the management giving up their salaries entirely; many contractors and third-party staff may be let go of, the reports say. Loss-making hotel aggregator OYO furloughs or lays off thousands of staff across markets and cuts salaries. Companies freeze operations around the world. One by one, consumer internet startups with little income but a lot of supposed scale see funding drying up. Retrenchments, furloughs and pay cuts across the board. Airlines, media companies, automakers and more follow suit.

You carry on with work, but dread starts to grow. You try to make sense of revenue projections maybe, or sales plans for an always vaguely distant yet hopefully close “post-COVID” world. The numbers don’t really make any sense; every day, you overhaul them. The management opens up, at the very least, there won’t be any annual increments, and everyone can forget about bonuses.

Everybody is scared. Friends, friends of friends, acquaintances, neighbours, it’s likely that someone you know has been fired, furloughed or faces the immediate threat of the axe—maybe even you. Sign in to read more.

BMR

To calculate your BMR, you’ll use your sex, age, and weight. The original formulas for calculating this number are as follows, using pounds for weight, inches for height, and years for age.

66 + (6.2 x weight) + (12.7 x height) - (6.76 x age) = BMR for men
655.1 + (4.35 x weight) + (4.7 x height) - (4.7 x age) = BMR for women

Example: A 40-year-old, 150 pound, 5 foot 6-inch-tall woman, for example, would be 655.1 + (4.35 x 150) + (4.7 x 66) - (4.7x40) = 1,429.7.

"The Scottish Bill does not require intent. All the Crown has to prove is that ‘it is likely that hatred will be stirred up’ by the accused’s words or deeds. The maximum penalty will be up to seven years in prison and/or a fine.
Sloggett points to Boris Johnson’s infamous burqa column as an example of speech about followers of a religion which, though objectionable to many, would be ‘ludicrous’ to prosecute."
tags: scary, freedom of speech.

The bill has some general flaws.
This bill was the brainchild of Scotland’s Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf.
Focusing on the question of religion: The National Secular Society (NSS) initially welcomed the Bill as it removed the offence of blasphemy from Scots law.
---
Blasphemy law in the United Kingdom: Laws prohibiting blasphemy and blasphemous libel in the United Kingdom date back to the medieval times as common law and in some special cases as enacted legislation. The common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel were formally abolished in England and Wales in 2008. Equivalent laws remain in Scotland and Northern Ireland but have not been used for many years.

Why do so many incompetent men become leaders? | Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic | TEDxUniversityofNevada
There is a pathological mismatch between the qualities that seduce us in a leader and those that are needed to be an effective leader. Based on research on the psychology of leadership, Chamorro-Premuzic shows that if leaders were selected on competence rather than confidence, humility rather than charisma, and integrity rather than narcissism, we would not just end up with more competent leaders, but also more women leaders. In fact, he argues, the main obstacle preventing competent women from becoming leaders is the lack of career obstacles for incompetent men.  Dr. Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic is an international authority in psychological profiling, talent management, leadership development, and people analytics. He is the Chief Talent Scientist at Manpower Group, co-founder and CEO of DeeperSignals and Metaprofiling, and Professor of Business Psychology at both University College London, and Columbia University. He has previously held academic positions at New York University and the London School of Economics, and lectured at Harvard Business School, Stanford Business School, London Business School, Johns Hopkins, IMD, and INSEAD, as well as being the CEO at Hogan Assessment Systems. Dr. Tomas has published 10 books and over 150 scientific papers, making him one of the most prolific social scientists of his generation. His work has received awards by the American Psychological Association and the Society for Industrial-Organizational Psychology, to which he is a Fellow. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx


Truth Bombs:
1. Have you ever worked with people who are not as goog as they think? [Crowd bursts into laughter]
2. I know this will surprise you, but statistically, they're more likely to be male than female.  [Crowd bursts into laughter, again]
3. Men are most likely to succeed in their careers. That's because one of the best ways to fool other people into thinking that you are better than you actually are, is to fool yourself first

Notes from the video:
----------------------------------------

Lessons for myself:
1. It took my 8 years to reach conclusion that women make a big difference to work force. The group I was in (Engineers mainly) believed women don't work long hours and are there just for time pass/money. We included them more like embellishments. It took me all of 8-10 years to muster courage to set a target to recruit 35% women when we were hardly 10%. In five years when our business peaked, we were 40-45% women. Still, there is much to change in white collared India. Both men and women have to shed distrust and turn more professional.
2. It took me 8-10 more years to learn to measure integrity and humility. One reason for our group's strength was to spend most time testing competence. We were paranoid about that and I think competence had much correlation with humility and integrity (a person who knows his subject matter well had no reason to act overconfidently or cheat professionally).. Sometimes interviews went on for 4-5 hours to test competence (Interestingly, someone called me two months ago claiming she started using our testing examples and said the discrimination in identifying competent people was significantly better!). But we struggled with identifying humility and integrity.
3. Integrity is a tough one and identifying it requires grey hairs and some wisdom. How do you stop someone from fudging numbers in a report? It is almost impossible to check every statistics in a report. And if one person lacking integrity goes up the ranks, he or she spoils the whole basket. One thing we did was to call previous employer, asked to speak to their work colleagues. For those coming from colleges, we asked their Professors. It is not easy to make them speak on integrity but you have to ask for "What is that one thing you want them to improve? What advice would you want to give them to improve their integrity with their friends?" My boss had deeper wisdom. He would recruit if one parent was a govt school teacher or a govt doctor. He had many such soft parameters and he was usually right on those vague measures. I lacked that wisdom perspective.
4. Humility is also tough to identify. In interview situations most are coached to be artificial. A silly question we used to ask "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?" would elicit "In your seat! (Followed by a laughter)" was not easy to conclude as over confidence or foolish coaching. But I found one question as a very good way to find out humility (but that requires competence of interviewer too): "Tell me one technical area you are an exceptional expert in?" The initial hesitation gave some clue but what happened subsequently helped nail humility. Here are two examples: (a) An Overconfident fraud lacking integrity : "While I know you may not need this expertise but I am exceptional in Thermodynamics!" (He thought he could get away because he took the wager that most 40+ years olds would not know the subject or would have forgotten) Me "Tell me the three laws of thermodynamics!" He "Don't remember" (b) A humble guy: "Sir, I think I might be good in BCG Matrix" Me: "Tell us the axes or if each Maruti car was a business unit where would they fall in the four quadrants etc.," Typically, anyone can be made to fail on a topic at some stage as questioning gets complex. How they respond by being eager and their closure asking for feedback etc., could be a good measure of intellectual humility.
Our best people were self effacing. The problem was, learning from most clients I worked with, the surfeit of overconfident, rude and untrustworthy people (one lady on client side would regularly call and yell "I want a head to roll today for this mistake." I felt uncomfortable imagining myself as a king walking around the floor with a sword slung to my side!). Many of them who went to client side were exports of our industry. And that perpetuated a vicious cycle when my colleagues would suggest "Please recruit a confident, smooth talker who can handle these aggressive people." I tried my best to resists such advice.
If only we learnt how to identify better leaders, the world would be a better place. Corporate India, especially MNCs, recruit rude, over confident, narcissistic people lacking integrity. In India, in lala companies, only the owner is allowed that luxury.
Modi was easy for me. I listened to him for 3 months in 2013. His incompetence, overconfidence and poor integrity were visible when I checked his claims against records. The most scary thing was some news items were removed after I had visited and checked sources. That was enough evidence for me not to vote. I would rather not fill a vacancy than put a wrong guy in my office.

But we never fully learnt to measure empathy... First of all, it was inadequately available with young and privileged classes we were getting. I was keen on larger empathy with world. One or two questions which were asked as essays gave some clue "Should beggars be allowed to beg on Indian streets. Discuss pros and cons." My other favourite was "What do you think about reservation in education?" Most kids who applied to us would argue against it (usually the Merit argument) and I would flip it and ask "Give 3-5 reasons if you are asked to write in support of reservations" Most people fumbled at first reason. In hindsight, I wish I had invested more on empathy. We still ended with way too many selfish people for my comfort. My worst nightmare was facing them argue over their increments. We probably had more than 60%+ selfish oriented. That will remain my deepest regret. Selfish people are rarely thankful to the world.

Sabu din raati adha re mote feel huye - hey bhagwan agaku kana haba?

"Kana jibana sara emti eka eka kati jiba?"

If YES, then, give me a sign, and i will happily cope up with that.
But you have to fix/mend my surroundings for it - parents, society & everything.
I don't want to be treated as an outcast.
I want to remain as acceptable as I was yesterday.


If NO, then, give me a sign too.
Help me finding the woman.
But also help me with the trust issues I have.

.
.
.
.
. 
this is what happens with me..


I can live with lonliness.
I can sit every night like this & sob in the corner.

What I can't live with, is..
.. thinking about approaching every other woman I know
.. in the hope of a relationship
.. and then bail out at the last moment because of the burgeoning trust issues

Approaching every other woman is...
1. Invasive - people will hate me, and given that I m not pretty, I will be labelled a predator
2. Humiliating - it feels as if I m begging. I'm in the fix where I'm too dignified to beg, too poor to get it for self.

Biryani	& The election: The Dynamics

We've already told you in this article about how Biryani is culturally important to our country. Here are a few excerpts:
In Hyderabad, a boom in Biryani sales was noticed around the time of election campaigning
In Chennai, contests for the Assembly are often dubbed Biryani Bypolls for the goodies that are showered on the voters. 
In Baroda, before a Ranji Trophy match between Uttar Pradesh and Baroda, a man with a casserole emerged from the crowds and shouted to get Yusuf Pathan's attention, "Yusuf bhai ek autograph de do, aapke liye biryani laya hoon." 
When Sania Mirza visited the sets of "Dilwale" with a box of Hyderabadi biryani for Farah Khan and the rest of the crew.
During Bangalore Riots, a woman arsonist set afire 42 buses for biryani & Rs 100

Being Al'Jal-Jeera must be fun:

First, you pretend to be a nice guy, wear nice clothes, talk nice. You probably have champagne in your hands, defying all preconceived notions everyone had about you.

Second, you make informative documentaries about science, tech, and futurology. You talk about culture, music, movies, and artists. People start trusting you because of your attention to detail.

Then, you talk about the rights of minorities, social justice & pretend to be the voice of the poor. You create content that evokes emotions like sympathy and sometimes despair.

But all this while, you don't reveal that you're actually a little bitch.

A few days later, when you've developed a nice 'unsuspecting' fan base, you slyly slip in your agenda. But, you do it extra carefully though. Like, really carefully. You use this appeal-to-emotion strategy to bring people on your side slowly. And for the creatures humans are, people will definitely be on your side even after knowing that you are a snake, a predator, a backstabber. Or, maybe even worse.

Then, one fine day, you get your break and you go all guns blazing. Your covert operation has been successful. Congratulation!

Just unfriended a guy who calls himself a fanboy of Christopher Hitchens, but has rarely ever anything to offer other than strawman fallacies, ad hominems, whatabouteries, innuendos and negative labellings.

Can’t stop thinking about this movie. #Capernaum Saw it 3 days ago. Didn’t know when I watched it that the cast members were real people. Including these 2 phenomenal kids. Story of a young boy who sues his parents to stop having children they can’t afford. It’s about that and so much more. Surviving the daily traumas of being poor,proving your existence matters with no “papers.” Was nominated for Golden Globes. Hope the same happens for Oscars so more people can see it. Really worthy of your time. #Capernaum means chaos.

FAB BANK Mass Layoff: Asked To Resign Instead Of Being Terminated 
https://redd.it/giakar

First Abu Dhabi Bank has laid-off hundreds of employees. The HR gave the employees a document where it was mentioned that employee has resigned and the bank has accepted their resignation. The HR played the usual tactic of convincing employees to sign on the resignation letters & discouraged them to go through the 'termination' route and said that they can mention it's a "termination", but <the employee> "should not come back later asking them to change it to a resignation, because many employees regretted choosing termination". The HR said it's better for the employees to choose a resignation because it will be easier for the employees to find a job later. Plus, they can be rehired by FAB if the economic situation improves. Per HR, the end of service benefits were same for both "termination" & "resignations".
================================================
What to do in case of a Co-erced Resignation:

• Ideally, an employee is encouraged not to participate i.e. not to sign on a resignation letter voluntarily.

• Companies have a mandate to pay Arbitrary Termination Money and as well as [return] Ticket money compensation in Dubai. The co-erced resignations acquit the companies of all such responsibilites.

• Employees can raise an MOHRE complaint & file an Arbitrary Dismissal Claim. The employees would need to demonstrate that they were not given the option to take paid/unpaid leave and/or temporary/permanent salary reduction before the dismissal.

• Employees should also focus on their EOSB(End of Service Benefit), a severance payment that is owed to an employee after termination or resignation, and determine which one suits their needs best. The EOSB is enforced after 1 yr into employment in the UAE, and is based on a daily pro rata amount of salary. Therefore, employees who've served longer will obtain the maximum benefits when their employment is severed. For UAE, the worker is owed 21 days of pay for each year of employment, for the first five years, and it goes up to 30 days afterwards. Therefore, majority of employees that chose Termination over Resignation usually get a higher exit-cheque. Sometimes it can be 3x higher. The EOSB is also applicable to Expat workers.

• Payment for your Annual Leave Balance (policy may vary from org. to org.) 

• If you are terminated, your employer cannot charge you incase you have a bond with the company.
• If you are terminated, you can waive off your loans, if you have that insurance on your loans.


Also, another word of advice:
• Keep written record of everything. Record all calls (without necessarily telling them). But try to keep things in a written format as much as possible. 
• Refrain from participating in public forums using your original identity while still living in Dubai. Don't post any defamatory post on social media where it can be traced back to you.
• Countries in the middle east have a bad reputation when it comes to slap-suits (lawsuits by large corporations on individuals who do not have the resources to fight back). You can be arrested by the police for spreading misinformation.


================================================
1/ Resignations will not count as layoffs in terms of statistics. For a company, "Termination" is bad. Resignations are better.
2/ In case of mass layoffs, a company can be subjected to class action lawsuit. It's possible in UK, US and Europe. But do verify your local law & procees with caution.
3/ Penalty for arbitrary dismissal: Under the Labor law, an unlimited term contract can only be terminated for a valid reasons. A valid reason is usually considered by the courts as having to do with poor performance, etc.  which has to be documented and it is not redundancy due to financial problems unless they can show for instance an entire part or all of the business has shut down. The maximum penalty that can be awarded by the courts is 3 months pay but of course you have to go to court to get this so you can choose to accept less as a compromise. 

If you, the employee, resign, then the employer (FAB) will only pay you 1 to 3 mo the salary as a favour.
If your employer terminates, the Labour Law states that the employer (FAB) has to pay 6 months of salary, a return ticket for family (full fare), severance pay, relocation allowance and commissions/ bonus/ incentive if it was not paid in full for each year/ quarter etc.

Coronavirus impact: Will job loss insurance help if you get laid off?
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/insure/the-truth-about-job-loss-insurance-not-as-dependable-as-you-may-think/articleshow/59048754.cms?from=mdr

• A job loss insurance cover is a type of insurance policy that can tide off financial exigencies.
• It isn't a stand-alone policy. It is usually available as an add-on with other polices that cover larger risks such as accident and critical illness. It is offered under policies such as critical illness, personal accident cover, home insurance, etc.
• Rakesh Goyal, Director, Probus Insurance an Insurtech Broking company says that currently, a stand-alone unemployment policy is provided only under Rajiv Gandhi Sharmik Kalyan Yojana (RGSKY), which is the only traditional unemployment insurance in India supported by ESIC on behalf of the Government. But the Government is looking forward to making amendments in availing the unemployment benefits under the Atal Beema Vyakti Kalyan Yojana (ABVKY) for those who have subscribed to the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC).
================================================
What is not considered a job loss: 
• Job loss due to reasons other than retrenchment as a result of merger or acquisition
• Unemployment of a self-employed person
• Unemployment due to voluntary resignation or early retirement
• Unemployment during probation period
• Any termination, suspension or retrenchment from employment due to poor performance of the insured
• Job loss due to pre-existing diseases and health conditions
• Job loss due to disciplinary action.

What it covers
• The insurer pays only the three biggest EMIs that you have running and it is usually capped at 50 per cent of your income. 
When it kicks in
• There is a waiting period of one-to-three months before the cover comes into effect. The claim can be made only once during the term.

Remember to enquire about these grey areas:
Insurance companies don't have same conditions for job-loss covers.
Do enquire about the following before you buy the cover:
• Are you eligible for the claim if the employer offers you severance pay?
• Will you get the claim if the employer gives you a notice before termination as per your contract?
• What happens if you have been fired but do not have a written document to prove it?


Note:
-----
Written proof of retrenchment is one of the crucial documents that is required to assess the cause of job loss. The job-loss policy triggers only if the termination is due to the conditions included in the policy and is not a voluntary resignation by the customer. Hence documentation citing the reasons and circumstances of termination is important," says Sasikumar Adidamu, Chief Technical Officer at Bajaj Allianz General Insurance.

Meet the advisors who helped make the BJP a social media powerhouse of data and propaganda

Rajesh Jain
BJP IT Cell


Cyril Sam & Paranjoy Guha Thakurta
13-16 minutes

By the time Rajesh Jain was scaling up his operations in 2013, the BJP’s information technology (IT) strategists had begun interacting with social media platforms like Facebook and its partner WhatsApp. If supporters of the BJP are to be believed, the party was better than others in utilising the micro-targeting potential of the platforms. However, it is also true that Facebook’s employees in India conducted training workshops to help the members of the BJP’s IT cell.

Helping party functionaries were advertising honchos like Sajan Raj Kurup, founder of Creativeland Asia and Prahlad Kakkar, the well-known advertising professional. Actor Anupam Kher became the public face of some of the advertising campaigns. Also assisting the social media and online teams to build a larger-than-life image for Modi before the 2014 elections was a team led by his right-hand man Dr Hiren Joshi, who (as already stated) is a very important adviser to Modi whose writ extends way beyond information technology and social media.

Currently, Officer On Special Duty in the Prime Minister’s Office, he is assisted by two young professional “techies,” Nirav Shah and Yash Rajiv Gandhi. Joshi has had, and continues to have, a close and long-standing association with Facebook’s senior employees in India. In 2013, one of his important collaborators was Akhilesh Mishra who later went on to serve as a director of the Indian government’s website, MyGov India – which is at present led by Arvind Gupta who was earlier head of the BJP’s IT cell.

Mishra is CEO of Bluekraft Digital Foundation. The Foundation has been linked to a disinformation website titled “The True Picture,” has published books authored by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and produces campaign videos for NaMo Television, a 24 hour cable television channel dedicated to promoting Modi.
The 2014 Modi pre-election campaign was inspired by the 2012 campaign to elect Barack Obama as the “world’s first Facebook President.” Some of the managers of the Modi campaign like Jain were apparently inspired by Sasha Issenberg’s book on the topic, The Victory Lab: The Secret Science of Winning Campaigns. In the first data-led election in India in 2014, information was collected from every possible source to not just micro-target users but also fine-tune messages praising and “mythologising” Modi as the Great Leader who would usher in acche din for the country.

Four teams spearheaded the campaign. The first team was led by Mumbai-based Jain who funded part of the communication campaign and also oversaw voter data analysis. He was helped by Shashi Shekhar Vempati in running NITI and “Mission 272+.” As already mentioned, Shekhar had worked in Infosys and is at present the head of Prasar Bharati Corporation which runs Doordarshan and All India Radio.

The second team was led by political strategist Prashant Kishor and his I-PAC or Indian Political Action Committee who supervised the three-dimensional projection programme for Modi besides programmes like Run for Unity, Chai Pe Charcha (or Discussions Over Tea), Manthan (or Churning) and Citizens for Accountable Governance (CAG) that roped in management graduates to garner support for Modi at large gatherings. Having worked across the political spectrum and opportunistically switched affiliation to those who backed (and paid) him, 41-year-old Kishor is currently the second-in-command in Janata Dal (United) headed by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.

The third team, that was intensely focused on building Modi’s personal image, was headed by Hiren Joshi himself who worked out of the then Gujarat Chief Minister’s Office in Gandhinagar. The members of this team worked closely with staffers of Facebook in India, more than one of our sources told us. As will be detailed later, Shivnath Thukral, who is currently an important executive in Facebook, worked with this team. (We made a number of telephone calls to Joshi’s office in New Delhi’s South Block seeking a meeting with him and also sent him an e-mail message requesting an interview but he did not respond.)

The fourth team was led by Arvind Gupta, the current CEO of MyGov.in, a social media platform run by the government of India. He ran the BJP’s campaign based out of New Delhi. When contacted, he too declined to speak on the record saying he is now with the government and not a representative of the BJP. He suggested we contact Amit Malviya who is the present head of the BJP’s IT cell. He came on the line but declined to speak specifically on the BJP’s relationship with Facebook and WhatsApp.
The four teams worked separately. “It was (like) a relay (race),” said Vinit Goenka who was then the national co-convener of the BJP’s IT cell, adding: “The only knowledge that was shared (among the teams) was on a ‘need to know’ basis. That’s how any sensible organisation works.”

From all accounts, Rajesh Jain worked independently from his Lower Parel office and invested his own funds to support Modi and towards executing what he described as “Project 275 for 2014” in a blog post that he wrote in June 2011, nearly three years before the elections actually took place. The BJP, of course, went on to win 282 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, ten above the half-way mark, with a little over 31 per cent of the vote.

As an aside, it may be mentioned in passing that – like certain former bhakts or followers of Modi – Jain today appears less than enthusiastic about the performance of the government over the last four and a half years. He is currently engaged in promoting a campaign called Dhan Vapasi (or “return our wealth”) which is aimed at monetising surplus land and other assets held by government bodies, including defence establishments, and public sector undertakings, for the benefit of the poor and the underprivileged. Dhan Vapasi, in his words, is all about making “every Indian rich and free.”

In one of his recent videos that are in the public domain, Jain remarked: “For the 2014 elections, I had spent three years and my own money to build a team of 100 people to help with Modi’s campaign. Why? Because I trusted that a Modi-led BJP government could end the Congress’ anti-prosperity programmes and put India on a path to prosperity, a nayi disha (or new direction). But four years have gone by without any significant change in policy. India needed that to eliminate the big and hamesha (perennial) problems of poverty, unemployment and corruption. The Modi-led BJP government followed the same old failed policy of increasing taxes and spending. The ruler changed, but the outcomes have not.”

As mentioned, when we contacted 51-year-old Jain, who heads the Mumbai-based Netcore group of companies, said to be India’s biggest digital media marketing corporate group, he declined to be interviewed. Incidentally, he had till October 2017 served on the boards of directors of two prominent public sector companies. One was National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) – Jain has no experience in the power sector, just as Sambit Patra, BJP spokesperson, who is an “independent” director on the board of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, has zero experience in the petroleum industry. Jain also served on the board of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), which runs the Aadhar programme.
Unlike Jain who was not at all forthcoming, 44-year-old Prodyut Bora, founder of the BJP’s IT cell in 2007 (barely a year after Facebook and Twitter had been launched) was far from reticent while speaking to us. He had resigned from the party’s national executive in February 2015 after questioning Modi and Amit Shah’s “highly individualised and centralised style of decision-making” that had led to the “subversion of democratic traditions” in the government and in the party.

Bora recalled how he was one of the first graduates from the leading business school, the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, to join the BJP because of his great admiration for the then Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee. It was at the behest of the then party president Rajnath Singh (who is now Union Home Minister) that he set up the party’s IT cell to enable its leaders to come closer to, and interact with, their supporters.

The cell, he told us, was created not with a mandate to abuse people on social media platforms. He lamented that “madness” has now gripped the BJP and the desire to win elections at any cost has “destroyed the very ethos” of the party he was once a part of. Today, the Gurgaon-based Bora runs a firm making air purification equipment and is involved with an independent political party in his home state, Assam.

He told us: “The process of being economical with the truth (in the BJP) began in 2014. The (election) campaign was sending out unverified facts, infomercials, memes, dodgy data and graphs. From there, fake news was one step up the curve. Leaders of political parties, including the BJP, like to outsource this work because they don’t want to leave behind digital footprints. In 2009, social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp had a marginal impact in India’s 20 big cities. By 2014, however, it had virtually replaced the traditional mass media. In 2019, it will be the most pervasive media in the country.”

Bora is of the view that social media will “play a perverse role” in the 2019 general elections. He went to the extent of comparing the BJP’s IT cell with SIMI or the Students’ Islamic Movement of India, which has been banned by the government for its extremist character. At the same time, the founder of the BJP’s IT cell sees a silver lining in the dark clouds of disinformation that pervades the country’s social media. “Residents in these 20 big cities are now growing suspicious of social media,” he said, adding: “They no longer blindly trust everything that is put out on WhatsApp.”

Bora had left the IT cell and moved to Assam to work for the BJP by the time Nitin Gadkari replaced Rajnath Singh as BJP president. A Mumbai-based IT specialist, who is close to Gadkari, then played an important role in helping the party organise its internet and social media strategies. He was Vinit Goenka. Like Bora, he was loquacious in telling us how the party used Facebook and WhatsApp to spread the BJP’s agenda and boost Modi’s image.

Unlike Bora, however, Goenka remains firmly aligned with the party and particularly with his political mentor. He is a member of a task force on IT in the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, both headed by Gadkari. Goenka is also a member of the governing council of the Centre for Railway Information System (CRIS) in the Ministry of Railways headed by Piyush Goyal.

At one stage in our interview with Goenka that lasted over two hours, we asked him a pointed question: “Who helped whom more, Facebook or the BJP?”
He smiled and said: “That’s a difficult question. I wonder whether the BJP helped Facebook more than Facebook helped the BJP. You could say, we helped each other.”

Having been a member of the party’s youth wing since 2003, with Gadkari’s prodding, Goenka joined the BJP’s IT cell in Maharashtra in 2008 to help “modernise” the party. His first successful initiative was to supervise the setting up of high-definition video conferencing facilities in different districts of the state to enable leaders like Gadkari to interact regularly with the BJP’s karyakartas (or party personnel).

He did not look back thereafter and rapidly expanded his operations across the country. By the time election campaigning started picking up in late 2013, he had put together a network of over 78,000 people who were fully engaged in aggressively promoting the interests of Modi and the BJP in rural blocks and urban wards in 29 states and seven Union Territories. Significantly, in each group, one person was deputed to focus on the social media, Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter.

Goenka also played a key role in connecting BJP’s leaders with IT industry bigwigs, including Som Mittal and Rajendra Pawar and business associations like the Indo–US Business Council. He helped his party organise regular meetings with IT professionals and entrepreneurs. The meetings were called “Let’s Talk Governance” and held every Saturday at the BJP’s office at 11 Ashoka Road in central Delhi.

Speaking to us in his office in south Delhi, he recalled: “In 2012, the liberal media fiefdom broke with (the rise of the) social media. Politicians started interacting directly with their constituents. The period between 2012 and 2014 was a period when the Congress government was being exposed for corruption. (People’s) trust in the government and the media was falling...We started reacting to the media and started writing on the internet. Everyone was empowered. But we used...(the social media) better than others.”

Forty-six-year-old Goenka, who used to work with IBM and belongs to a Mumbai-based family that has been traditional supporters of the RSS, told us: “We made a network of NRIs (non-resident Indians) in the US and asked each one of them to call their contacts in India to participate in online activities including live chats, liking pages and participating in online groups on Facebook and WhatsApp.”

India Against Corruption - Wikipedia
6-8 minutes

India Against Corruption (IAC) is an anti-corruption movement in India which was particularly prominent during the anti-corruption protests of 2011 and 2012, concerned with the introduction of the Jan Lokpal bill. It primarily sought to mobilise the masses in support of their demands. Divisions amongst key members of the IAC's core committee eventually led to a split within the movement- Arvind Kejriwal left to form the Aam Aadmi Party, while Anna Hazare left to form Jantantra Morcha.


Rise
The IAC popular protest movement began in 2011 as part of a larger wave of demonstrations and protests. The official position of figureheads in the IAC movement was that it had no formal organisation beyond a 24-member core committee.[1] In 2011, the organisers of IAC determined to launch a campaign to mobilise the masses in support of a demand-the creation of a Lokpal (ombudsman) who would have powers to arrest and charge government officials accused of corruption.,[2][3][4] that they hoped would help to bring about a corruption-free India. The campaign gained strength through social media, building a massive network of supporters. Initially, they approached Ramdev, a populist Indian yogi to be the figurehead for this campaign but his connections to the right-wing Sangh Parivar threatened to damage the credibility of what was perceived as an apolitical movement[citation needed]. This led to him being replaced by Anna Hazare, a veteran social reformer. Hazare, too, brought a large support base with him, described by Meera Nanda as being largely "from urban middle-classes and idealistic youth". The urban sophistication of Hazare, compared to Ramdev's rusticity, attracted high-profile support for the campaign from Bollywood stars, the internet-savvy, and mainstream English-language news media.[4]


Internal split
In 2012, the IAC began to splinter with Hazare's followers coming to be known as Team Anna.[5] By late 2012, the split had deepened, caused by differences of opinion among the central figures regarding the IAC's lack of practical success and its unwillingness to be directly engaged in the political system. An IAC survey of the masses suggested that direct involvement in politics was preferable, leading to Arvind Kejriwal and some others splitting to form the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in order to cause change from within the system. Hazare rejected the survey findings.[6][7]

In August 2012, Hazare announced that he was disbanding Team Anna, around the time that the divisions were coming to a head.[8] In November 2012, after the split, he said that he was forming a new Team Anna, that it would retain the label of India Against Corruption and that its members were discussing other societal issues to be addressed.

The new Team Anna, sometimes referred to as Team Anna 2.0, prepared to tour the country from 30 January 2013, coinciding with the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.[11] On 30 January 2013, Hazare announced that he had formed Jantantra Morcha, a campaigning group that included the previously-named members of Team Anna 2.0 and which he considered to be a replacement for IAC but with a broader agenda.


Criticism
Historian and commentator Ramachandra Guha has questioned the image that has been presented of IAC and of Hazare. Acknowledging that Hazare had previously been successful in campaigns for infrastructure reforms at the local level in his native Maharashtra and that the IAC campaign of 2011 had an impact, Guha doubts the claims that the 2011 and 2012 protests overwhelmingly engaged the masses. He notes that liberals were concerned with a perceived anti-democratic rhetoric while socially oppressed communities, such as the dalits and Other Backward Classes, were worried that the "savarna" led movement would undermine the gains they have made through legislative reforms, such as those resulting from the Mandal Commission. He considers that the attention given to the protest by 24-hour news channels and internet resources has masked the realities, such as that popular participation at the Jantar Mantar and Ramlila Maidan protests in Delhi was a fraction of that evidenced in Kolkata in 1998 when 400,000 marched in an anti-nuclear movement. Guha further said that scandals, such as the 2G spectrum case, were high-profile examples of the endemic corruption prevalent in Indian society at all levels but the IAC solution — the Lokpal — was only a "simplistic" reaction.

Too dignified to beg, too poor to buy (self.india)

submitted 12 hours ago by retartedindian

While waiting in a queue to buy groceries a young woman approached me and shyly asked for a packet of cooking oil. I found it rather strange that she didn't ask any money. She opened her face cover and I could see a feeling of resignation, defeat in her face. She wasn't a beggar but did not have enough money to buy. Clearly, she needed more than just cooking oil.

I asked her to stand in the queue and buy whatever she wanted. She could have bought anything but she took only 4 things - oil, rice, groundnuts, and tea powder. She waved good bye and disappeared.

This whole situation has really attacked human dignity more than anything else. What a colossal tragedy!

An extraordinary $1m damages claim against NSW police and prosecutors who pursued a Sydney man over a string of allegedly false rape and assault claims by his estranged wife has been settled out of court, just days before it was to go to hearing. The rare capitulation by police and the prosecution marks the end of the man’s five-year ordeal, in which he claims he suffered “severe mental anguish” after his former wife told police he had raped her, three weeks after the pair had split up in May 2015. In his statement of claim before the NSW Supreme Court, the man, identified only as DC, said the marriage had ended after he discovered his wife — a medical specialist with a serious opioid addiction — was having an affair. He said when his wife had visited him at the matrimonial home on June 15, 2015, there had been a brief reconciliation and the couple had consensual sex in the lounge room. The court heard that for the next few days the couple had exchanged loving texts, but the communications quickly became acrimonious and the communication ended. Two months later, DC was arrested at Sydney airport after returning from Europe on a work trip. It was another month before he was released from jail. “There seems to be a trend that anybody accused of sexual assault must be guilty, which completely overrides the presumption of innocence,’ Mr Walsh said. “These are ideologically driven prosecutions — even in the absence of hard evidence — and it is a considerable concern.” Mr Walsh told the NSW Supreme Court the police and the prosecution had appeared to be so hellbent on prosecuting his client they had ignored critical evidence that the former wife was lying and had failed to test the woman’s allegations at every stage of their investigation. This included critical CCTV security vision of the alleged rape when the wife visited DC at their matrimonial home on June 15, 2015. Mr Walsh said the security vision, which captured the sexual encounter in the lounge room, showed the wife’s version of events had been “wilfully false, including her claim that DC had attacked her on arrival at the home. The CCTV vision, he said, had provided “substantial evidence” of his client’s innocence. Yet when he bought it to the attention of the Crown, the prosecutor had retaliated by laying more charges against his client, including attempted anal and vaginal rape. In subsequent communic­ations, he said, the prosecutor had ­denied ever sighting the CCTV footage, even though it had been included in the police brief provided to the defence. Mr Walsh said after DC’s wife realised there was CCTV footage, she and other family members had hired a private investigator in an “attempt to compromise or otherwise prejudice” her former husband. DC has always maintained his former wife had deliberately fabricated the rape claims against him, fearing he would report her to health authorities after he had told one of her medical colleagues she had a “longstanding addiction” to the opiate painkiller Tramadol. He said his former wife’s addiction­ had driven her to illegally prescribe drugs for herself, including in his name, and compromised her capacity to perform as a medical practitioner. After a 10-day trial in the NSW District Court in 2017, all the charges against DC were thrown out after Judge Mark Williams issued a rare Prasad direction, instructing the jury they could find DC not guilty on the grounds there was not enough evidence to justify a conviction. Judge Williams went on to describe the evidence’s of DC’s wife as “demonstrably false”. He also demanded to know what steps, if any, had been taken by the police and the prosecution to corroborate her complaint. “When I heard those words from the trial judge, I got quite angry and upset,’ Mr Walsh said. “Why didn’t police and the prosecution just take those basic steps?”

Modi govt wants to retire more ‘corrupt’ officers but their colleagues refuse to name them
Dilip Mandal -
4 minutes

The government intends to compulsorily retire employees seen as deadwood by invoking Fundamental Rules 56 (J) and Rule 48 of Central Civil Service (CCS) Rules 1972, which allow forced ouster of staff in public interest.
New Delhi: The Modi government seems to be facing pushback from government officials in its attempt to purge corrupt and non-performing employees.

The Modi government is unable to extract names of corrupt officers, but it is able to suspend IAS officers in Delhi. Bravo

```Renu Sharma, a 1988 batch IAS officer who was posted as Additional Chief Secretary (Transport) and Rajeev Verma, a 1992 batch IAS officer who was Principal Secretary, Finance, in the city government have been suspended.```

Your baby mama is the mother of your baby, whether you are in a relationship with her or not. Alas, the popular connotation of the term is that you're not in a relationship, often making baby mama disparaging or offensive, depending on the context. The term baby mama became more common used in black US slang from the 1980s onward. By the 1990s, it was commonly found in hip-hop lyrics. The expression went mainstream with OutKast’s 2000 hit “Ms. Jackson,” which was dedicated to “baby mamas’ mamas.” The term baby mama became more common used in black US slang from the 1980s onward.

The five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model

The Kübler-Ross model, or the five stages of grief, postulates a series of emotions experienced by terminally ill patients prior to death, or people who have lost a loved one, wherein the five stages are: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.  Although commonly referenced in popular media, the existence of these stages has not been empirically demonstrated and the model is not considered helpful in explaining the grieving process.[1] [2] It is considered to be of historical value but outdated in scientific terms and in clinical practice.[3]

Dear Society, It Is Useless To Raise Independent Daughters If You Don't Teach Men To Respect Them
Shivangi Taneja
3-4 minutes

https://www.iforher.com/society-it-is-useless-to-raise-independent-daughters-if-men-not-respect-them/

Though many parents strive really hard to raise their daughters as strong and independent women, it is heartbreaking to see how these women struggle post-marriage for respect and dignity.It is not only a matter of shame but also an irony. We raise our daughters to be independent but forget to teach our sons to respect them. While raising children, many 21st century parents think of upbringing them equally, be it a girl or a boy. But do they?    We may raise our daughters to be career-oriented, but we forget to raise our sons to learn how to cook! Our daughters may know how to file taxes but our sons may not have any idea about doing laundry! We may raise our daughters to drive but forget to teach our sons how to sweep the floors! Our daughters may know how to invest in share markets but our sons don’t have any idea how to make food! One may say that raising independent women is way more important than raising men to learn household chores. But is it? What we have done so far for in uplifting our daughters i.e. focus on their education to make them career-oriented and financially independent is absolutely right and needed to be done. But, what we forgot in our quest to uplift our daughters is to change the mindset of our sons. Without that change, our sons would still perceive our independent daughters as educated cooks or maids. It is heartbreaking to see how for every woman who is taught that she can be more than just a housekeeper and cook, there is a man who believes that household chores are only woman’s jobs. By raising your daughters to believe in themselves and in their dreams and giving them the freedom to make their own choices, you are doing only half the work. If you don’t teach your son how to do laundry, cook basic meals or do domestic chores, you are raising an entitled son. He would always expect his wife to cater to his needs. And your daughter could end up marrying one of these entitled men. But what’s worse is when some of our independent daughters become a victim of domestic abuse. All because they do not live up to the expectations of the entitled man she married. So, a humble request to all those who are raising their daughters to do whatever their sons could, please raise your sons to do whatever your daughters could. Raise your sons to respect these independent women and treat them as equals. Because it is useless to raise independent women if you’re still raising entitled men.

In the future it will be impossible for women to escape the digital footprint of their sexual pasts. They collectively know this. Thus, it's necessary to socially condition men to believe their 'manhood' is insecure if they hold any standards for women.

James Miler If he did know anything about the subject he would have explained why the equivalence is invalid instead of just claiming it in between an emotional takeover. Regarding that not-made-up-at-all statistic, it would seem more believable that most american victims are either oblivious to their issues or unable to speak up due to stigma. Also, your equivalence is the false one because piercing is literally different from multilation of any kind by definition; chopin off a children's ear would be a more appropriate comparison but yet not quite since it's not genital which would obviously be worse.

Some thoughts on why Libertarians empowering the oppressor is inherently wrong :

I'm making an assumptions.
First: People who think Libertarians empower the oppressor rely on a state or government to work in their favor and do away with oppression. Now,
Libertarians are individualists. They are all for the right of an individual to decide rules for their private property. So, for example, on one hand if there's a bigot who wishes to segregate racially, and not allow people of color to work, he would not face charges, however, might very well face social exclusion. But also, if you wish to employ people of all races you wouldn't be questioned either.

Let's talk of what the State has a possibility of doing:

Governments are formed by politicians, and politicians are swayed by the majority opinion.
So, if the majority believes that racial segregation is good, the government will NOT DO any thing to help the minority which thinks racial segregation is bad.
Additionally, if the minority thinks they want to employ black people, they'll be BANNED from doing that.

Now if the majority of people don't want racial segregation, the majority of them won't discriminate in a Libertarian society either.
But if the majority is racial, in A Libertarian society the minority gets to choose their way, but under state they don't get it either.



	Rohit Balakrishnan: Watch closely. 90% of the left would rather point-score against libertarians conveniently hiding that they're by and large not supporting the morals of a discriminatory policy but their moral and legal right to decide what to do in their own spaces, subject to mutual consensus.

	Spandan Bhattacharya: I rather differ here. Governments WOULD be swayed by majority opinion, if governments were democracies. But they are not. Governments are democratic republics to begin with. Governments are legally bound to follow the constitution, or we might as well have seen far more regressive policies. We need a state, and we need the state to actively protect the subaltern.

	Sabdashwa Chakraborty: Whatever state you're talking about here it's definitely not a constitutional democracy.

The myth of the Alpha entrepreneur
=============================
This is a timely book and available on Audible. The thing about this book is it walks into the backwaters of entrepreneurship and so much venture into the big ocean filled with successful sharks a Bezos or Zuckberg or Musk.

Very early, the author learns there is no standard definition of an entrepreneur. And he realises that anyone who doesn't have a regular paycheck, takes on risks and enjoys the freedom of own work is actually an entrepreneur. And you realise it covers a wide swathe of people...farmers, plumbers, book store owners...even migrant workers in an fast changing economy like ours who survive doing odd jobs. I have to include myself too. I have existed for last 8 years as an independent.

A few things that make the book interesting. It explores how an entrepreneur treats his work as an additional member of his family...the emotional attachment to his work (in the other hand employees have been disengaging more and more with their employment work!). If also affirms (something I posted earlier) that older people are more successful in business. Contrary to views, American Millenials are less entrepreneurial then earlier generations. But that is also a trend wrought by general disincentives for small businesses to succeed post Reagonomics America. What is interesting is the high growth of female entrepreneurship.

It is likely the COVID crisis will accelerate pace of entrepreneurship what with massive job losses in big companies.

This books worth lies in its focus on the inner mind of an entrepreneur and not the usual glamourisation around Ideas, VC, disruptive innovation etc., We realise the avant garde pastry shop around the corner is as much an entrepreneur as an Elon Musk with a similar appetite for risk and a penchant for innovation.

Between 1970 and 2000, the cost to launch a kilogram to space remained fairly steady, with an average of US$18,500 per kilogram. When the space shuttle was in operation, it could launch a payload of 27,500 kilograms for $1.5 billion, or $54,500 per kilogram. For a SpaceX Falcon 9, the rocket used to access the ISS, the cost is just $2,720 per kilogram.

In 2018 alone, SpaceX made 21 successful launches. The new Falcon Heavy rocket – a more powerful version of the Falcon 9 – launched in February. This rocket can lift 63,800 kilograms, equivalent to more than 27 Asian elephants, to low Earth orbit and 16,800 kilograms to Mars for just $90 million. The test payload was Musk’s own red Tesla Roadster, with a mannequin named Starman in the driver’s seat.

We need to question our addiction to cultural and political economy of alcohol
PB Mehta writes: There is very little worry about the forms of dependence on alcohol that, in crucial moments, take away our ability to exercise or recognise consent, exercise good choice or act like an agent. The liberal case for encouraging moderation is actually stronger than the conservative case.
https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/drink-for-thought-india-lockdown-alcohol-addiction-6397378/lite/?__twitter_impression=true


In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev, launched an ill-fated anti-alcohol campaign in the then Soviet Union. According to Gorbachev’s biographer, William Taubman, the campaign followed on a high-powered Politburo report that worried about the deleterious consequences of excessive drinking in the Soviet Union: Annually, 12 million drunks arrested, 13,000 rapes attributed to alcohol, along with 29,000 robberies. The anti-alcohol campaign had some beneficial public health consequences: Crime fell and life expectancy rose. But the campaign was a political and economic disaster.

Gorbachev forgot that the addiction of the state to alcohol revenue was even more incurable than the addiction of some citizens to alcohol itself. The budgetary losses created an economic crisis. Historians suspect that more than the loss of the Soviet Empire, it was this campaign that delegitimised Gorbachev. An old Soviet joke went like this: A disaffected and angry citizen, fed up of standing in lines for vodka, decided to go assassinate Gorbachev. He soon came back and ruefully reported that the lines to assassinate Gorbachev were even longer than the lines for vodka.

As the lockdown eased in India, and social distancing went for a toss at alcohol outlets, we were reminded of how difficult an issue alcohol is to rationally discuss in India. The stampede was caused by the ineptness with which the opening was handled in most cities. If you open up after 40 days, and are uncertain about future closings, you will create a stampede. But the subject has been a political hot potato we shy away from. Like in Russia, it is difficult to wean many states away from the political economy of alcohol. It lubricates not just the state coffers but whole political machines. There is also the fear that simply discussing this topic puts you on the slippery slope to prohibition; acknowledging the problem will legitimise state repression. Alcohol has also migrated from being a question of personal freedom and choice to an issue in broader cultural wars, an odd site on which we measure progressivism in India. It is also a window on how liberalism has been misunderstood.

Liberals should, rightly, be suspicious of prohibition on moral and practical grounds. Government grossly exceeds its legitimate power when it interferes with the rights of individuals to lead their lives as they please, and fashion their selves after their own ideals, interests and preferences. And certainly, moralism or puritanism on alcohol cannot be the basis of state policy. That moralism has no basis, and it violates the dignity and freedom of individuals.

But one of the paradoxes of liberalism is this. In order for liberal freedoms to flourish, society requires more self-restraint and judgment, not less. The state should not interfere with any freedom of expression. But freedom of expression will not survive, or be rendered relatively meaningless, if social norms that flourish under this freedom simply use freedom as a cover for hate or subordinating others. The state should not interfere in matters of sexuality or intimacy. But norms of freedom will impose serious costs and will not survive if the expressions of sexuality are consistently degrading or violent, as we have seen in the locker room scandals. The state should not interfere with people’s right to drink; but there will be a backlash if drinking takes forms that inflict great social harms. As every real liberal has always understood, defining the limits of state power is the intellectually easy part for liberalism. The harder part is to ask how we fashion subjects who understand both freedom and moderation. Both depend on each other.

There is a bizarre reluctance in India’s elites to think that all the following propositions cannot be true simultaneously. There is no justification for the state to prohibit people from drinking. That choice should be preserved. But there is a serious social problem in the form that drinking takes. According to the WHO, 5.3 per cent deaths worldwide are linked to alcohol, and in the age group 20 to 39, this figure rises to 13 per cent. The evidence on the relationship between alcohol and sexual and intimate partner violence globally is overwhelming. You just have to peruse the papers from any research centre on the issue, from La Trobe University’s Centre for Alcohol Policy Research, to Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, to gauge the scope of the problem. Just to take random examples: Ingrid Wilson and Angela Taft of La Trobe University estimated that in Australia alcohol is involved in 50 per cent cases of sexual assault and 73 per cent intimate partner assault. This figure is quite representative for most countries. Many studies suggest that alcohol accounts for at least 50 per cent of campus assaults. The women in Bihar who support prohibition have a better sense of the underlying social science, even if we might disagree with their solution.

Alcohol in many elite contexts is not about exercising individual choice. Alcohol has almost become an ideology, with a messianism of its own kind. Most of my non-drinking friends who have returned from abroad agree that it was far easier to navigate sociability in the United States, than it is in a city like Delhi, where drinking has more or less become a marker of progressivism, or non-drinking of reaction. Amongst young people it is often presented not as a choice, but a compulsion of membership. And finally, there is something odd about converting alcohol into an ideology.

Some conservatives do that by moralising about alcohol. But progressive elites are even guiltier of bad faith in this respect. On the one hand, we rightly valorise consent, choice and agency. On the other hand, there is very little worry about the forms of dependence on alcohol that, in crucial moments, take away our ability to exercise or recognise consent, exercise good choice or act like an agent. The liberal case for encouraging moderation is actually stronger than the conservative case.

None of this is an argument for prohibition. Quite the contrary. But we should, as Yogendra Yadav pointed out, think more soberly (no pun intended), about policy measures that reduce the harm and ideological valorisation of alcohol: Education on intelligent drinking, community intervention, regulating outlet density of alcohol shops, greater control over surrogate advertising, franker social conversation that there is actually a problem. Good liberals need to defend freedom of choice. But if we really care for freedom, we also need to question our own addiction to the cultural and political economy of alcohol, and find intelligent pathways around a complex problem.

FALSE: A year ago, 14-year-old astrologer Abhigyan Anand had made a prediction about the corona virus.

Explanation: We listened to the said video which was uploaded on 22 august 2019 but the name of coronavirus was not mentioned anywhere in the 15 min long video. This false claim originated from: Many media outlets, Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter. The #CoronavirusFacts database records fact-checks published since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. The pandemic and its consequences are constantly evolving and data that was accurate weeks or even days ago might have changed.

Indian liberals/progressives are overall very much out of touch with ground reality and they make very little effort to make their ideas attractive to the common man or the swing-voter. They're mostly concerned with winning the supposed moral high-ground on the internet and attacking people for not being "woke" enough rather than increasing the appeal of their ideas and growing as a movement.

	Comment: Written from the perspective of a hypocrite
	Strange!!!

	Morals - why does something as basic as morals need to be made attractive? ..why does it have to be a luxury of the liberals?.. more importantly why do we need a movement to tell people "do the right thing" ?

		Rohit Balakrishnan
		1. Do we want good ideas to remain in the fringes of the society or spread to the mainstream? That's the reason why we want good ideas to be attractive.

		2. There's a lot of bad things in the society. While we can endlessly lament about how we shouldn't have to tell people moral basics, the reality is that we need to solve problems and bring progress to society.


Surender Singh Negi
Actually the real problem is that Literalism in India is not home grown. It's copied from west , hence no relativity with common Indians. First,The liberals need to understand that they can't use the same methodology of west in India. Second, Indian liberals need to understand that culture and dharma in India wasn't same as western religion. Hence unverified criticism, unnecessary demonizing and imposing western worldview will not work. They need to grow home philosophy for that. In that case I do agree with sadguru (Jaggi) and Rajiv Malhotra(Author) as they don't sell western literalism in India. They want to reform India not replace it.


	Rohit Balakrishnan
	What we should look at is not whether something is western or Indian, but whether it is good.

	If it's a cultural activity that makes Indians happy, we don't need to reject that obsessively.

	But not every Indian cultural tradition is necessarily good. If it amounts to a social evil, it should be rejected.

	Surender Singh Negi
	I agree. But again every idea has foundation and it's laid over it. It become universal when it's extream good. My point is that it's not necessary that liberalism is need of India while we have very similar philosophy of "Dharma" and "Moksha" very much organic to this land. In my opinion western liberalism is very good but not organic. Also it should not imposed on people of india as law. It can be mix with the local philosophy and accepted.
	Although I agree that not everything in culture is necessary good and it must be rejected/reform.

Breaking news in our Apartment WhatsApp group
================================
A. Our apartment shopkeeper proudly told someone his son works in COVID quarantine ward and helping. Now, an effort is on to close his shop temporarily for fear he may be source of spread. Fight has broken out between members.

B. Maids were banned until 17 May after much fight (no voting but the Excom decided). But people are writing emotional mails "I am suffering from diabetes, leg in plaster...living alone.. exceptions should be allowed.."

The Chinese curse is literally and figuratively coming true ..."May you live in Interesting times!"



Rama Vennelakanti
Well our apartment let the house help in after the usual difficult to manage without them plaints! They however got rid of one old time housekeeping guy without notice and hired another. No reason given. What I figured was the M factor.
They would rather see the only store down the road shut too I guess for the same reason but them that would leave them high and dry!
I just watch the happenings. I let my house help go long before the Janta Curfew and would rather they don’t come back for the next couple of months.
We do live in interesting time - whether it is a curse or an adventure we will find out.

A more enlightened view on why more pandemics will happen. Abusing eating habits or blaming wet markets etc., are not going to help.

//They also emphasised that bat culls and bans on wet markets were likely to be ineffective and could prove counterproductive because bats play an important role in insect control and plant pollination. “Living safely with bats is what we should be focusing on, not eliminating them,” Evans said.//

More stupidity in Apartment Management
==================================
Didn't know that our apartment scans temperature of all those who visit (staff as well as delivery boy). They have invested in this tech as well. Apparently, today an Amazon Delivery boy was found running 100°F and so they didn't accept the parcel (even though they don't allow any delivery boy beyond the gate). Fight broke about in Whatsapp group about how Corona doesn't survive on carton etc., Another said we should raise threshold temp to 101°F since the delivery boy may not be regularly hydrating himself and may have heated up in this scorching weather (reminded me of old Ambassador cars!).

More learnings just now: Someone has stocked up on PPE kits. He is suggesting we all invest and after 17th May let Maids wear it. Someone else is wondering about logistics of cleaning PPE kits after the maids use it.

I am very concerned Coronavirus is eating into our brains.
☺
This will be a bit long: Cities themselves are like islands, or castles full of parasites. They don't produce food, or water. They depend on others for it. That too, on a regular basis. A slight delay or miss in delivery of an essential & the whole city will be in utter chaos. Typically, all city-people are parasites. And it's been a personal observation since quite some time that people in the national capital are the worst forms of it. Perhaps it's because several generations have lived in Delhi for far too long & have gotten used to the "government sponsored" prosperity - air conditioned buses & metros, wider roads, housing & even parks.

This prosperity has attracted a large pool of cheaper, dispensable work force that works for them as maids or carpenters or plumbers or any other blue collar profession.

People in Delhi have gotten used to these "perks" of living in the national capital.

Humans have a tendency to undervalue things that we earn easily. Similarly, the 2nd or 3rd generation Delhi-ites did not have to work for any of the aforementioned. They had it easy. They don't appreciate what they already have. But somehow, they assume that it's their birth right to have all of these anyway.


Everything that the (central) government provides by stealing the prosperity from other regions.

Why does installing node 6.x on Ubuntu 16.04 actually install node 4.2.6?
https://askubuntu.com/questions/786272/why-does-installing-node-6-x-on-ubuntu-16-04-actually-install-node-4-2-6
These were my steps to install node on Ubuntu 16.04:
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs 
sudo apt-get install -y npm

which are the official instructions:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions
After doing this, running nodejs --version returns v4.2.6.
As I used setup_6.x I was assuming a version beginning with 6 would be installed? 

The core reason is that the setup script didn't run correctly. Therefore, thanks to the updated data from the OP which supports this, the data from the NodeSource repository was never seen by apt because it was not properly configured by the script.

The script, therefore, may not have found your distribution, or it may have messed up when configuring the repository, or there may have been a network interruption, or any of a thousand reasons it was disrupted and didn't do its job.

The fact you are seeing version 4.x getting installed means that the script didn't do its job right, so the script is not necessarily at fault. This just means we have to potentially do this a harder way.

    I should point out: the script doesn't actually do any installing - all it does is determine the Debian/Ubuntu version you're on, and configure the repository for it to get data from. The installation part is actually the sudo apt-get install step you ran by hand.

Rather than rely on the script, we can do what the script is doing the old-school way: by hand, ourselves, set up the repository configuration and install NodeJS.

Here's the manual way of making this work, and it is basically what the script does (except for Step 4, which is to make sure you are getting accurate version data):

    Create a new file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nodesource.list

    You'll need to create this file with sudo, but when you create the file, put this inside it:

    deb https://deb.nodesource.com/node_6.x xenial main
    deb-src https://deb.nodesource.com/node_6.x xenial main

    Then, save the file. (replace node_6.x with node_7.x or node_8.x, etc. for newer Node versions)

    Download the GPG Signing Key from Nodesource for the repository. Otherwise, you may get NO_PUBKEY errors with apt-get update (use wget in this command if curl isn't installed, and if neither are installed, install one of them):

    curl -s https://deb.nodesource.com/gpgkey/nodesource.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -

    Manually run sudo apt-get update.

    This refreshes the data from the nodesource repo so apt knows a newer version exists.

    If you get a NO_PUBKEY GPG error, then go back to Step 2

    Check apt-cache policy nodejs output.

    This is not done by the script, but you want to make sure you see an entry that says something like this in the output (though the version might be different if you are not using 6.x as the version string; the only thing we care about is that there's a newer version number provided via nodesource):

    Version table:
        6.2.1-1nodesource1~xenial1 500
           500 https://deb.nodesource.com/node_6.x xenial/main amd64 Packages
        4.2.6~dfsg-1ubuntu4 500
           500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial/universe amd64 Packages

    If you do not see entries like this, and only see 4.2.6, start over. Otherwise, proceed.

    Install the nodejs binary. Now that you have confirmed 6.x is available on your system, you can install it: sudo apt-get install nodejs

    nodejs --version should now show v6.2.1 or similar on output (as long as it starts with v6. you're on version 6 then; this may be a higher version number if you're using a newer version than 6 but as long as it is not 4.2.6 you should be good to go).

Understanding special octal values

chmod (Unix-like operating system command): In Unix and Unix-like operating systems, chmod is the command and system call which is used to change the access permissions of file system objects. It is also used to change special mode flags. The request is filtered by the umask. The name is an abbreviation of change mode.

Octal Value: An "Octal Value" or "Number Value" of a file permission is simply a numeric value, composed of 3 or 4 digits, each one ranging in value from 0 - 7, that represents access grated to users on the system. These octal values, can be used to change or manage a file or directory's permissions, using a well known command-line-utility called chmod. Obtaining a specified "Octal Value" usually starts with a file's "Symbolic Value", and transmuting it to it's corresponding number value. In this case, ---x--x--x converted to it's Octal or Number value is 111. For further information on how to transpose file permission's symbolic values to their octal counter part; or to get a better grasp on "Octal Notation" in general, see our guide on the subject - How to Understanding Octal Notation. 


Symbolic Value: File Permission's "Symbolic Value", or "Symbolic Notation", is a string made up of 10 characters that represents access granted to users on the system. Each "Symbolic Value" string is broken down into 4 sections. The file type (file or directory), Owner, Group, and Other in that order. The file is the first character (either d or -), while each of the subsequent groups (owner, group, and other) are represented by each subsequent cluster of three characters. In short, a "Symbolic Value" is the "string" based counterpart of a corresponding "Octal Value". In this case, 755 converted to its symbolic counterpart is "-rwxr-xr-x". If you're looking for info on how to obtain a symbolic value, or how to transpose an octal value to symbolic notation see our guide on the subject - How to Understanding Symbolic Notation

India in the post-pandemic world
Sujatha Singh April 28, 2020 00:06 IST Updated: April 28, 2020 10:45 IST
7-9 minutes

Yes, we all know that the world we once knew has gone, perhaps forever. Much has changed and will continue to. What has not changed though, is human nature itself. The way we react, as a species to the unknown, or to an existential threat, on a scale not experienced in recent times, to something that we cannot quite comprehend as yet, in its entirety.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

We have arrived, once again, at the boundaries of the human race’s collective knowledge, and it is sobering to be reminded that what we do not know is much greater than what we do know, about ourselves and the world we live in.
 
A leadership role

The fact that there is no end in sight to the COVID-19 crisis does not prevent us from making prognoses of what a post-COVID-19 world may look like. The pandemic has added heft to arguments of foreign policy analysts across the entire spectrum of strategic thinking, from nationalists and anti-globalists, to advocating a more robust multilateralism and a leadership role for India in mobilising international cooperation.

I believe, however, that before we get too involved in the contours of a post-pandemic world, we first need to think about where we are headed as a post-pandemic India. Yes, there will be a churning as nations scramble for advantage in the world order as the pandemic recedes, but I think we need to be more concerned at this point of time with the social and economic churning under way within our own country, accentuated and magnified by the COVID-19 crisis.

The role that India plays in the post-pandemic world order will be determined by how we deal with the crisis now, and how we emerge from it. This, in turn, depends on certain fundamental factors — the quality of leadership, the quality of administration at all levels, (Centre, State, district and village), the robustness of institutional frameworks, the quality of health care, and our social coherence as a people.

Admittedly, the manner in which some of these have functioned recently, does not engender great confidence. Further, the manner in which we have dealt with the pandemic until now has made it painfully clear, as nothing else has in recent times, that there are two Indias — an India in which social distancing is possible and an India in which it is not.
 
Crucial investments

The COVID-19 epidemic has mercilessly highlighted our shortcomings and our failures, even as we pride ourselves on being the world’s largest democracy and its fifth largest economy. It has highlighted our age-old fault lines of caste, class and creed. There are still too many inequalities, and too many of us who have been left behind, on whom the effects of the lockdown have been the most severe, compounding the economic distress of recent years.

Yes, the lockdown was necessary in order to pause the spread of the pandemic. However the manner of its implementation, without the government of India even foreseeing, much less planning for, the consequences of such a step, or coordinating with States in advance, or spelling out how it would support the millions so affected, was harsh in the extreme on the poorer sections of our population. It was starkly reflected in the thousands of migrant workers believing (not without reason) that they were invisible to the Establishment, and not knowing what else to do, leaving by foot, trying to reach the only safety net they had — extended families and homes in their villages.
 

There lies grave danger here, of both the health and the economic consequences of the crisis intersecting amongst our poor, with potentially devastating consequences for them as well as for our overall attempt to manage the novel coronavirus.

It often takes a crisis to bring about fundamental change. Can one dare hope that this crisis too will bring about such change for the good? That it will bring about the policies and mindsets necessary to deal with the injustices and inequalities so painfully magnified by recent events?

It is time for the government to lay out a comprehensive road map to deal with both the health and the economic consequences of the crisis, and to make long overdue investments on the massive scale needed, in universal health care, education and social security. Or at least to plan for it, and to raise the resources to back these plans with adequate funding, regardless of the fiscal deficit that will follow.

In its absence, we run the risk of social disorder, as witnessed in Bandra (Mumbai), Surat (Gujarat) and other parts of India where our poor are in lockdown. Growing perceptions of injustice and of the government’s indifference to their plight could well lead to widespread outrage that would be difficult to control.
 

The investment that needs to be made in the millions of our people who live in poverty, or on the edge of it, are not merely welfare measures. They are fundamental to our socioeconomic transformation, which in itself is an imperative. Also, if India is to be in any position to make use of opportunities that emerge in the reordering of the global economy as the pandemic recedes.
On the global stage

In parallel with an inclusive, all-of-India effort on the domestic front, India needs to be part of international efforts to deal with the COVID-19 crisis — multilateral, regional or bilateral. It makes sound humanitarian as well as strategic sense for us to supply medicines of which we are the major producers (dependent though we may be, on China for 70% of the active pharmaceutical ingredients needed to produce them), to other countries. It is also important that we participate in international efforts towards finding a vaccine and ramp up capacities to produce it in the quantities needed, both for our own people and for the world.
 

Yes, the world will have changed by the time the crisis recedes, but we, the human race, will continue to be what we have always been — relentless in our search for wealth and power, both within nations and without. On the international front, nations will continue to strive for strategic advantage in furthering their interests and constrained by realpolitik in striving for the common good. Countries that emerge in positions of relative economic advantage will present competing visions for the post-pandemic world order. If we wish to play a leadership role and to present a vision for a more inclusive world defined by international cooperation, then we need to back it with our own example, on the domestic as well as the international fronts.

I believe that in any post-pandemic world order that emerges, regardless of whether it is U.S.-centric or China-centric, there is no scenario in which India, a universe in itself, and home to one-sixth of humanity, will not occupy a place. The question is this: Will we emerge as part of the problem or as part of the solution? Will we emerge weaker or stronger as a nation? Will we have been guided by divisive political agendas that deepen our fault lines? Or will we have worked towards an inclusive India that embraces all of us in its fold, regardless of caste, class or creed? The pandemic has brought us to an inflection point. How we deal with it will determine our place in the future world order.

Armed black citizens escort Michigan lawmaker to capitol after volatile rightwing protest


https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/michigan-lawmaker-armed-escort-rightwing-protest?utm_term=Autofeed&CMP=fb_us&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Facebook&fbclid=IwAR1QIt4ZEvtqSeTt3IhDobYGEApEcLlWLeO1bhohS8MuAENaNs5ZkMO9EK0#Echobox=1588902566

A black lawmaker came to Michigan’s capitol with an escort of armed black citizens on Wednesday, days after white protesters with guns staged a volatile protest inside the state house, comparing the Democratic governor’s public health orders to “tyranny”.

The state representative Sarah Anthony, 36, said she wanted to highlight what she saw as the failure of the Michigan capitol police to provide legislators with adequate security during the protest, which saw demonstrators with rifles standing in the legislative chamber above lawmakers.

“When traditional systems, whether it’s law enforcement or whatever, fail us, we also have the ability to take care of ourselves,” she told the Guardian. Anthony became the first African American woman elected to represent her district in Lansing, Michigan’s capital, in 2018.

One of Anthony’s constituents, a black firefighter, organized Wednesday’s capitol escort. While early reports focused on three black men with large rifles escorting Anthony, there were six participants, including two women, and some of them were armed with handguns, Lynn said. Five of the participants are black and one is Hispanic. Michael Lynn Jr, a Lansing resident, said he was frustrated to see his legislator being violently intimidated in her workplace. He said the escort was the first time he had ever chosen to openly carry his AR-15 rifle.

Lynn said he did not want to see a black woman who had been elevated to political office feeling threatened “because of the white supremacists in the yard” and wanted “to make sure that would never happen again”.

“Being a black and brown female Democrat in the capitol now is a dangerous job,” Lynn said. “This is an environment that Donald Trump has nurtured.”

Anthony described last week’s protest, which drew hundreds of people, as “one of the most unnerving feelings I’ve ever felt in my life”.

“If I don’t vote the way that these people want me to vote, are they going to rush the and start shooting us?” she said. “You could feel the floor rumbling. You could hear them yelling and screaming.”

Despite the armed escort, Anthony said she was “actively working to prohibit open carry” of firearms in the state capitol, which is currently legal.

Anthony said her goal was not to encourage more armed citizens to volunteer to protect lawmakers, but to ensure that the law enforcement officers paid by taxpayers to keep legislators safe would do a better job in the future.

Lynn, 38, is a gun rights advocate who has a permit to carry a concealed handgun in public, but he called the armed white protesters’ behavior “ridiculous” and “barbaric”.

“What they did and what they intended to do,” he said, was to “derail democracy”.

Lynn said he was frustrated after last week’s protests when he saw black Americans sharing comments that they would never be allowed to carry guns in the capitol and scream into the faces of police officers.

There was truth to those perspectives, he said; the response would have been different. But he also wanted to “change the narrative”.

“We can’t normalize that narrative to where it seems as if we’re supposed to be scared to exercise our second amendment rights as everyone else does,” he said.

Wednesday was a quiet work day at the capitol, and “the state troopers were very accommodating. Nobody acted as if we should not be there,” Lynn said.

Michigan’s state capitol has been the scene of several large protests demanding that the state’s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, reopen the economy. ﻿

While police at the capitol usually do an adequate job of protecting lawmakers, Anthony said, she felt law enforcement had simply left them to their own devices during last week’s protest.

A spokeswoman for Michigan’s state police said that they were “constantly reviewing” their practices and “adjusting protocols as needed”.

The state police hosted a call with legislators on 4 May to brief them on available security services, including security escorts, after “ learning that some representatives were fearful for their safety” during the protest, a spokeswoman, Shannon Banner, wrote in an e-mail.

Anthony said it had been meaningful to receive a personal offer from constituents to help ensure her safety. But, she said, “the thing that I hope does not happen with this photo is that this creates an environment that would feel like more guns are needed in order to protect ourselves.”

“The thing that keeps me up at night is the fear that we are becoming more polarized, more angry,” Anthony said. “My fear is real that we are creating an environment that is a powder keg, and I don’t want to see citizens of all stripes getting hurt.”

Looking for the perfect stranger
16-20 minutes

It was after three years of living in New York that I began thinking something was wrong -- deeply, heart-wrenchingly wrong -- with the Western dating system. I would come home after an evening of swapping New York "war stories" with girlfriends, in which we regaled each other with horrific dates or detailed every phone call and e-mail exchange from a short-lived fling in order to decipher why our intended had unceremoniously disappeared. Most of these evenings ended up with one or another of us whining about our loneliness and wondering when it would end, to be comforted by yet another in our gaggle that we should just get on with our own lives and not worry about men, and that soon enough, when we were least expecting it, love would walk in through the front door or sit next to us on a flight.

The next week we would switch roles and the whiner would offer warm words of advice and hand-holding to the comforter. I heartily participated in all of these discussions, more often than not as the one plunged in despair when I first arrived in New York, and later, hardened and somewhat resigned, as the one extending succor.

After months of these cocktail-drenched evenings, two fleeting thoughts slipped across my mind, which later would take on shape and bulk and eventually morph into full-blown arguments. The first of these took hold when a friend was complaining how a man she'd met at a party two weeks ago had seemed very interested and had taken her number but had not called since. And today she'd discovered that a colleague she had a crush on had a girlfriend. Two leads that had seemed promising just last week had fallen through, which in New York is enough to induce a midmonth slump.

I bit my lower lip and, ever helpful, said, "What about that guy you were talking about last month, the one you made out with at that bar in Soho?"

"Oh yeah, him. He's too young. I can tell he's not interested in something serious," my friend said.

Advertisement:

"Okay, well what about that guy Jason who's really into you and asking you out all the time? I think he's kind of cute," I offered hopefully.

"Eew," she said.

"Okay, what about going online? I know you're not really that into it, but ... I don't know. It just seems like there's no other way to meet somebody," I said, the first tendrils of my seedling thought stretching their tiny arms.

"I tried it. I only met freaks. I was just wasting my time," she moaned. "I just don't know where I'll meet someone."

Then the petals of my thought opened to reveal its essence. Yes indeed. Where are we in the West supposed to meet someone we'd like to marry, or at least be committed to? If we graduate from university without having found someone, we assume we'll meet someone over the next few years. But where exactly?

In many workplaces, romantic relationships are frowned upon, and people are often averse to dating someone in the office for fear it will end badly and they will still have to see their ex-lover on a daily basis. We are told that it's best to meet friends of friends. We all think this is a brilliant idea, until we realize that we've already met all of our friends' friends ... two years ago.

Then of course, there's the online route. Although the popularity of online dating in the last few years has somewhat reduced the stigma of having had to resort to the Internet to find a date, it's hardly a preferred method. Having found a girlfriend or boyfriend from an Internet site still seems the refuge of the desperate and socially isolated. And then there's the nagging little fact that many of us have tried online dating to no avail.

So then what?

This is when I found myself saying to my friend, "You're right. I don't know where you'll find someone, short of bumping into him on the street."

From that point on, I became mildly obsessed with the inadequacies of the Western dating system, or rather lack of it. Where exactly are we supposed to meet someone to marry?

For years, I never questioned the Western dating system. The tenets on which it rests seemed perfectly sound: after meeting a man or woman through work or friends, one gets to know him or her, and if one likes what one sees, one continues to deepen the commitment, which sometimes leads to marriage. What surprises me now is how much this system leaves to chance encounter, to a kind of fate or fortune. For a decidedly unmystical society that seems to have the answer for everything else -- the best medical care, cutting-edge technology, superhighways, and space shuttles -- it seems odd that people are left to their own resources, casting around for another lonely soul, for what is arguably the most important decision of their lives.

If the institution of marriage is present in every society that we know of, from Lapps in northern Sweden to aborigines, and nearly all cultures promote marriage as the foundation of society, isn't it odd, then, that there is very little provision for how it is supposed to occur in the West?

It was so obvious no organized system for marriage existed in the West that people simply failed to blame the obvious for why they couldn't find someone to marry. They were told by their therapists and their friends that it was because they were too neurotic, too unhappy, had to work on themselves before they could be happy with someone else, or that they wanted it too badly. People are told to blame themselves, and they do: they try to lose weight, they develop new interests, they get a nose job. We wonder what's wrong with us when really we should wonder whether there isn't a better way of doing things. It is a curious misplacement for a self-congratulatory culture in which people are constantly trying to shift blame away from themselves.

Once I began questioning the efficacy of the Western dating system in resulting in marriage, I started wondering why it is that wanting to be committed to someone else is too often associated with weakness in the West. I noticed that when people were happily self-sufficient, they liked to preach how they weren't looking for a serious commitment and didn't have time for one. It was only when they were dissatisfied that they began to think of marriage or commitment as a solution. But how many people are happily self-sufficient?

Does marriage have to be a salve to loneliness to have value? Isn't it valuable to begin with? In the West, the modern ideal is to be independent, on one's own, and to be able to make the choice to live with another human being, to welcome someone else as a bonus to one's existence -- if and when one is ready.

Couldn't one be a perfectly sound person who leads a far more purposeful life once engaged in a harmonious symbiosis with another human being? I certainly think so. Moreover, why do we have to be "perfectly sound" before we can meet someone? Why can't we be desperately alone and unhappy and become much more balanced or healthy after getting involved with someone? We've all seen this happen with friends -- "God, Peter seems so much happier now that he's going out with Jessica. He's not drinking as much." Conventional wisdom frequently tells us that we're happier when we give to others and focus less on ourselves, so it seems rather a glaring void that there is no institutionalized system of finding a mate in Western culture these days.

To admit to others that I yearned for a long-term commitment or marriage --which is basically to say that I wanted to be able to think about someone else for a change -- sounded regressive as soon as it emerged from my mouth. It was atavistic in nature, a throwback to a time when women couldn't financially support themselves. It was a piece of treacherous anathema in the age of strong, independent working women.

Of course, marriages were more or less arranged in Western cultures according to one's social status and wealth until the twentieth century, which ushered in a freewheeling era that allowed people to choose their own mates. However, no system stepped in to replace the practice of arranged marriage once it fell by the wayside, leaving a lot of young men and women lonely and frustrated. In the West, people are so resolutely convinced that they alone are equipped to choose their own mates that they readily give up their right to happiness in favor of self-determination.

In India, where my mother and father are from, marriages are routinely arranged by parents and extended family; marriage is not a choice. It just is. There is simply no concept of living a life alone. It happens here and there, but as a mistake, an unintentional slippage in society. In the West, people do it all the time, even relish it, saying things like, "I would rather live alone than with the wrong person." But spend ten minutes with most of these people and it becomes apparent that they are lonely.

I must confess that there was a third idea churning through my head, one considerably less broad and analytical, not to mention altogether more banal. And this thought was completely mortifying, yet enough within the realm of possibility that it kept my eyes pinned back and staring at the ceiling on more than a few sleepless nights. The bogeyman: namely that if I stayed in New York any longer I would end up growing old alone, "treating" myself to brunch every Sunday and the occasional Broadway show.

In my three years in New York, I hadn't come close to even having one romantic relationship. Dating felt like an absurd cat-and-mouse game, where people were more concerned about what they could get away with than with settling down -- "Can I keep dating other men? Do I have to give up my fuckbuddy if I actually like this woman that I'm dating?"

My dilemma was driven home one gorgeous Saturday in late May, one of the first days of the year with a limpid royal-blue sky and an undoubtedly summery climate. In short, the kind of day when everybody floods to Central Park for the first picnic of the season.

My friend Nadia, the one who gamely took it upon herself to introduce me to every available single man she encountered in New York, had invited me to a picnic. Nadia looked radiant, a few months pregnant with her first child. She'd brought three types of cheese -- Brie, Gouda, and Emmentaler -- and crackers, strawberries, grapes, a pasta salad with artichokes and tomatoes, and a few bottles of chilled white wine. I had shown up empty-handed and hungover from a late night out with some girlfriends, in which we ended up talking about ... guess what?

The ever-resourceful Nadia was talking to some of the others, her back to me, and I watched how the sun glinted off of her black, shiny hair. Her husband caressed her head for a few seconds while he said something into her ear. She let out a deeply felt laugh. I noticed the slight bump under her dress. And then I looked up at the sky, the dazzling, mocking clear blue sky. Lording over me, the firmament teased me, "See how happy you could be on a day like this? But you are not, because Kurt/Joe/Mark did not call you back after your date last week. How are you ever going to have a bump under your flower-print dress and a man to caress your head if no one even calls you after going out on a date with you?"

That was when I started crying, right in the middle of the picnic. Not sobbing gustily, or even audibly. But if you'd been looking at me, you'd have noticed a small torrent of tears gush down both sides of my face. Someone did, one of the husbands sitting on my right. He saw me with my plainly damp cheeks and, without saying a word, handed me his sunglasses.

I thought I should say something by way of explanation. He wasn't asking for one, but it seemed the proper thing to do. "I'm sorry, I'm just emotional today. It's ... it's just that dating in New York is so hard. I'm not sure I can do it anymore."

His naked eyes squinting into the sun, he nodded and half smiled sympathetically, not sure, of course, what I was really getting at. It took about another ten minutes to compose myself behind his sunglasses. I finally got up, handed back the sunglasses, said my good-byes, and walked through the throngs of picnickers. As I walked to the street and then to the subway station, my sobs were no longer soundless. They were loud, sniffling, and phlegmy. I was hyperventilating.

When I emerged from the train in my neighborhood in Brooklyn some three quarters of an hour later, it was still contemptuously brilliant outside. All the cafés on my street were crowded with merrymakers. That day, I literally ran home in tears.

I had become precisely the kind of woman I was determined not to become before I'd come to New York: that proverbial single thirtysomething female propped up at the bar waiting for her ship to come in. Despairing of another summer of Sunday brunches with the stodgy and unresponsive company of the New York Times, I knew I had to leave New York, but where could I go?

I suspected I would encounter the same kind of never-ending carousel of dates in other U.S. cities I would consider living in, like Los Angeles or San Francisco. Certainly single girlfriends I knew living in those cities had provided ample evidence of this. And in European cities I would have to learn a new language, not to mention compete with Monica Bellucci look-alikes who spoke four or five languages and could stand for hours in stilettos.

That was when I began to think of going to India. There are more men in India than women, around 930 women to every 1,000 men according to recent census data, the vast discrepancy a disturbing result of infanticide and sex-segregated abortion. And yet, it would work to my advantage, comparing favorably, of course, with the proportion of women to men in New York, which is always cited as something obscene like seven to one. This last figure may be an urban myth, but certainly it bore itself out anecdotally. Most parties I attended in New York featured thirty women and two men.

Statistics may be inappropriate evidence in an emotional argument, but they often are a last bastion of hope.

So I figured my options were simply more plentiful in India. I could go in for a strict arranged marriage, an "assisted" marriage, or I could merely date in a pool far more oriented toward marriage than the one I was dealing with in New York City.

I knew that arranged marriage certainly was no longer as entrenched in India as it was just a generation ago, losing its grip among a modern and urbanized segment of society. Outside of the major metropolitan cities, people still readily submitted to the practice. In cities like Delhi and Bombay, the vast majority of marriages were still arranged, but I'd also heard that a culture of dating and sleeping around was gaining ground. Nonetheless, in India, a desire to be married wasn't at loggerheads with the advances for which feminists had struggled. Even arranged marriage was acceptable in circles one would think had moved far beyond tradition. Bollywood megastar Madhuri Dixit left her career in 1999, when she was the highest-paid actress in the country's history, to marry a nonresident Indian surgeon from Los Angeles. Her parents arranged the union and the couple reportedly only met once before deciding to get married. Likewise, Aishwarya Rai, who was poised to make a transition from a successful Bollywood career to one in Hollywood, damaged her chances for superstardom when she chose to get married to the son of Indian film legend Amitabh Bachchan in 2007. She adopted her husband's last name and moved in with her in-laws.

As I sat on my couch drinking coffee before heading out to the subway in the morning, or in my midtown office struggling to focus on a story I had to submit by the end of the day, I noticed my mind wandering more and more to the idea of going to India.

People commonly go to India to find themselves or to find god, but I went to India to find a husband. I would give myself a year, what I figured was ample time in such a marriage-oriented society. In my mind, my decision also overturned two conventions, which, in the lexicon of the West, could be seen as nothing less than empowering. The first convention is that of an Indian man who has grown up in the West going back to the motherland to find a traditional, virginal, "simple" bride. The second is that of a South Asian woman being dragged back by her parents -- one hears of this more in the U.K. among Pakistanis and Bangladeshis -- to be married off, more often than not to a domineering and narrow-minded groom who restricts the freedoms she's enjoyed in the West. I willingly -- and willfully -- returned to find a modern Indian husband on my own terms.

Going to India to find a husband also raised other considerations. I wondered if I would be able to find someone modern enough in his thinking to be comfortable with a wife having a great deal of her own agency, not just in terms of making decisions for the household but in having a full life outside the marriage -- one that included going out with friends, drinking, and smoking. A woman who has had sex in the past -- and not just with those two long-term boyfriends. I wasn't sure what I would find, but I owed it to myself to try.

OtherMy boyfriend's dad called me his daughter-in-law yesterday self.LongDistance
submitted 2 months ago by LightTav
I've been in a LDR with my boyfriend(23)for 3 years now. Met in person for the first time last year(BR-US). And yesterday was my 25th birthday. I received a message from his dad on What'sapp wishing me a "happy birthday my daughter-in-law". It took me a minute to let it sink it but I truly almost cried when I read that. Due to the language barrier I just never felt all that close to his father. I never got the feeling that he didn't like me, nor did I really seek his approval. But going from jokes about being a random organ harvester online to being referred to as his daughter-in-law is pretty nice. Hope everyone on here has a good day. Just wanted to share my warm fuzzy news.

Recently, i was cc’d on an e-mail addressed to my father. It read, “We liked the girl’s profile. The boy is in good state job in Mississippi and cannot come to New York. The girl must relocate to Mississippi.” The message was signed by Mr. Ramesh Gupta, “the boy’s father.”

That wasn’t as bad as the time I logged on to my computer at home in Fort Greene and got a message that asked, forgoing any preamble, what the date, time, and location of my birth were. Presumably sent to determine how astrologically harmonious a match with a Hindu suitor I’d be, the e-mail was dismayingly abrupt. But I did take heart in the fact that it was addressed only to me.

I’ve been fielding such messages—or, rather, my father has—more and more these days, having crossed the unmarriageable threshold for an Indian woman, 30, two years ago. My parents, in a very earnest bid to secure my eternal happiness, have been trying to marry me off to, well, just about anyone lately. In my childhood home near Sacramento, my father is up at night on arranged-marriage Websites. And the result—strange e-mails from boys’ fathers and stranger dates with those boys themselves—has become so much a part of my dating life that I’ve lost sight of how bizarre it once seemed.

Many women, Indian or not, whose parents have had a long, healthy marriage hope we will, too, while fearing that perhaps we’ve made everything irreparably worse by expecting too much. Our prospective husbands have to be rich and socially conscious, hip but down-to-earth.

For some Indians, the conundrum is exacerbated by the fact that our parents had no choice for a partner; the only choice was how hard they’d work to be happy. My father saw my mother once before they got married. He loves to shock Americans by recounting how he lost sight of her at a bazaar the day after their wedding and lamented to himself that he would never find her again, as he’d forgotten what she looked like. So while we, as modern Indian women, eschew the idea of marrying without love, the idea that we’re being too picky tends to nag even more than it otherwise would.

Still, for years, I didn’t want to get married the way my brother did. He’d met his wife through a newspaper ad my parents had taken out. He’s very happily married, with a baby daughter, but he also never had a girlfriend before his wedding day. I was more precocious when it came to affairs of the heart, having enjoyed my first kiss with cute Matt from the football squad at 14.

Perhaps it was that same spirit of romantic adventurism that led me, shortly after college, to go on the first of these “introductions,” though I agreed to my parents’ setup mainly with an eye toward turning it into a story for friends.

At the time, I was working as a journalist in Singapore. Vikram, “in entertainment,” took me to the best restaurant in town, an Indonesian place with a view of the skyscrapers. Before long, though, I gathered that he was of a type: someone who prided himself on being modern and open-minded but who in fact had horribly crusty notions passed down from his Indian parents. I was taken aback when he told me about an Indian girl he’d liked. “I thought maybe she was the one, but then I found out she had a Muslim boyfriend in college,” he said. I lodged my protest against him and arranged marriage by getting ragingly intoxicated and blowing smoke rings in his face. Childish? Maybe, but I didn’t want to be marriageable back then. Indeed, I rarely thought of marriage at the time.

But for Indians, there’s no way to escape thinking about marriage, eventually. It wouldn’t be a stretch to say that shaadi, the word for marriage in many Indian languages, is the first word a child understands after mummy and papa. To an Indian, marriage is a matter of karmic destiny. There are many happy unions in the pantheon of Hindu gods—Shiva and Parvati, Krishna and Radha.

At a recent dinner party, when I was trying to explain how single-minded Indian parents can be, my friend Jaidev jumped to the rescue. “Imagine you are on a safari in Africa with your parents,” he said. “A lion strolls by, and then perhaps a tiger. Your mother turns to you and says, ‘Son, when are you getting married? You have a girl in mind? What are your intentions?’”

The pressure on me to find a husband started very early. A few days after my 1st birthday, within months of my family’s arrival in the U.S., I fell out the window of a three-story building in Baltimore. My father recalls my mother’s greatest concern, after learning that I hadn’t been gravely injured: “What boy will marry her when he finds out?” she cried, begging my father to never mention my broken arm—from which I’ve enjoyed a full recovery—to prospective suitors out of fear my dowry would be prohibitively higher. (A middle-class family can easily spend $100,000 these days on a dowry in India.) Much savvier in the ways of his new country, my father laughed it off. “But there is no dowry in America!”

Fulfilling his parental duty, my father placed matrimonial ads for me every couple of years during my twenties in such immigrant newspapers as India Abroad. They read something like, “Match for Jain girl, Harvard-educated journalist, 25, fair, slim.” I took it as a personal victory that they didn’t include the famous Indian misnomer “homely” to mean domestically inclined.

Depending on whether my father was in a magnanimous mood, he would add “caste no bar,” which meant suitors didn’t have to belong to Jainism, an offshoot of Hinduism with the world’s most severe dietary restrictions. Root vegetables like carrots are verboten.

Still rather prejudiced against meat-eaters, my father immediately discards responses from those with a “non-veg” diet. There is, however, a special loophole for meat-eaters who earn more than $200,000. (This is only a little shocking, since my last boyfriend was a Spanish chef who got me addicted to chorizo. Once, I was horrified to discover, he’d put a skinned rabbit in my freezer.)

This desultory casting around to see what was out there has become much more urgent now that I’m in my thirties, and in their quest, my parents have discovered a dizzying array of Websites: shaadi.com, indiamatrimony.com, etc. Within these sites are sub-sites for Indian regions, like punjabimatrimony.com. You might be surprised at who you’d find on them: the guy in the next cubicle, your freshman-year roommate at NYU, maybe even the cute girl you tried to pick up at a Lower East Side bar last night.

Far from being a novel approach to matrimony, these sites are a natural extension of how things have been done in India for decades. Even since well before the explosion of the country’s famously vibrant press in the fifties, Indians were coupling up via matrimonial ads in national papers (“Match sought for Bengali Brahmin, wheatish complexion,” etc.).

My father took to the Websites like a freshly divorced 42-year-old who’s just discovered Craigslist. He uploaded my profile on several, indicating that only men living in New York City need apply (nota bene, Mr. Ramesh Gupta). Unfortunately, in the world of shaadi.com, this means most of the men live in New Jersey, while working in IT departments all around New York.

My father also wrote my profile. This may be why dates are surprised to discover I enjoy a glass of wine or two with dinner, and another couple afterward, even though the profile says “I never drink.” And he writes back to those who appear aboveboard. This is no small task, as anyone who’s done any online dating can attest. As my father puts it, wagging his head, “You get a lot of useless types.”

Like most Indians of their generation, my parents believe there are only two legitimate professions: doctor and engineer (not medicine and engineering, but doctor and engineer). Yes, they’ve heard of such newfangled professions as investment banking and law, but, oh, no, they won’t be fooled. Across India can be heard the refrain, “It is good match: They found doctor,” and my father expects nothing less for his little girl.

The problem is that while he wants doctor or engineer, my heart beats for the diametric opposite. Take the aging but rakish foreign correspondent I was smitten with last year. Nearing 50, he’d just seen his marriage fall apart, and he mourned its passing by plastering his body with fresh tattoos and picking bar fights. I found it terribly sexy that he rode a Harley, perhaps less so that his apartment was decorated with Wonder Woman paraphernalia. He was on a downward spiral, but perhaps my parents might appreciate that he’d won a Pulitzer earlier in his career?

The relationship didn’t go anywhere, as my father might have warned me if I’d told him about such things. I will admit to needing a little romantic assistance. Since moving here a few years ago, I’d hardly describe my dating life as successful. There was Sadakat, the half-Finnish, half-Pakistani barrister from London who slept most of the day and worked most of the night writing a book on criminal justice. Circumscribed within this schedule, our dates would begin at midnight. Once I fell asleep on the bar during the middle of one.

Then there were the ones who simply never called again. The boy from Minnesota who imported women’s leather clothing from Brazil, the Cockney songwriter, the French dot-com millionaire.Perhaps I didn’t want to marry these men, but I certainly wanted to see them again. I began to feel baffled by Western norms of dating, what one Indian friend calls “dating for dating’s sake.”

    My father excludes “non-veg” suitors. There is, however, a loophole for meat-eaters who earn over $200,000.

Last summer, Alex, a handsome consultant I’d met at a party, invited me to his apartment for dinner. It was our first real date, and I was flattered—and encouraged—that he was already cooking for me. Soon after I arrived, we were drinking an Argentine wine I’d brought to go with his vegetarian lasagne, hewing to my restored dietary restrictions. Then, during dessert, Alex started talking about his long-distance Japanese girlfriend. I spat out my espresso. Not done yet, he also sought my advice on how to ask out the cute girl from his gym. Was it something I did? Perhaps I should have brought an old-world wine? Dating for dating’s sake indeed.

I’ve had greater luck attracting romantic attention (of a sort) on vacation. It was during a trip to Argentina that I met Juan Carlos, a black-haired, green-eyed painter—of buildings, not canvases. Within an hour of meeting me, he said he would become a vegetarian as soon as we married, that he’d never felt this way for any woman—“nunca en mi vida”—that I was the mother of his children. Oddly, by the end of the night, he couldn’t remember my name. Nothing fazed Juan Carlos, however. He quickly jotted off a poem explaining his lapse: “I wrote your name in the sand, but a wave came and washed it away. I wrote your name in a tree, but the branch fell. I have written your name in my heart, and time will guard it.”

Given such escapades, it may come as no surprise that I’ve started to look at my father’s efforts with a touch less disdain. At least the messages aren’t as mixed, right? Sometimes they’re quite clear.One of the first setups I agreed to took place a year ago. The man—I’ll call him Vivek—worked in IT in New Jersey and had lived there all his life. He took the train into the city to meet me at a Starbucks. He was wearing pants that ended two inches before his ankles. We spoke briefly about his work before he asked, “What are you looking for in a husband?” Since this question always leaves me flummoxed—especially when it’s asked by somebody in high-waters within the first few minutes of conversation—I mumbled something along the lines of, “I don’t know, a connection, I guess. What are you looking for?” Vivek responded, “Just two things. Someone who’s vegetarian and doesn’t smoke. That shouldn’t be so hard to find, don’t you think?”

It’s a common online-dating complaint that people are nothing like their profiles. I’ve found they can be nothing but them. And in their tone-deafness, some of these men resemble the parents spurring them on. One Sunday, I was woken by a call at 9 A.M. A woman with a heavy Indian accent asked for Anita. I have a raspy voice at the best of times, but after a night of “social” smoking, my register is on par with Clint Eastwood’s. So when I croaked, “This is she,” the perplexed lady responded, “She or he?” before asking, “What are your qualifications?” I said I had a B.A. “B.A. only?” she responded. “What are the boy’s qualifications?” I flung back in an androgynous voice. She smirked: “He is M.D. in Kentucky only.” Still bleary-eyed, but with enough presence of mind to use the deferential term for an elder, I grumbled, “Auntie, I will speak to the boy only.” Neither she, nor he, called back.

These days, I do have my limits. I’m left cold by e-mails with fresh-off-the-boat Indian English like “Hope email is finding you in pink of health” or “I am looking for life partner for share of joy of life and sorrowful time also.” For the most part, though, I go and meet the men my father has screened for me. And it is much the same as I imagine it must be for any active dater.

I recall the Goldman Sachs banker who said, in the middle of dinner, which we were having steps away from Wall Street, “You know, my work will always come before my family.”

Another time, I met a very sweet-seeming journalist for lunch in Chinatown. Afterward, I was planning to meet my best friend, who’s gay, in a store, and I asked the guy to come in and say hello. My date became far more animated than he’d been before and even helped my friend choose a sweater. After he left, I asked my friend what he thought. He gave me a sidelong glance, and we both burst into laughter.

As with any singles Website geared toward one community, you also get your interlopers. A 44-year-old Jewish doctor managed to make my dad’s first cut: He was a doctor. Mark said he believed Indians and Jews shared similar values, like family and education. I didn’t necessarily have a problem with his search for an Indian wife. (Isn’t it when they dislike us for our skin color that we’re supposed to get upset?) But when I met him for dinner, he seemed a decade older than he was, which made me feel like I was a decade younger.

My father’s screening method is hardly foolproof. Once, he was particularly taken with a suitor who claimed to be a brain surgeon at Johns Hopkins and friends with a famous Bollywood actress, Madhuri Dixit. I was suspicious, but I agreed to speak to the fellow. Within seconds, his shaky command of English and yokel line of questioning—“You are liking dancing? I am too much liking dancing”—told me this man was as much a brain surgeon as I was Madhuri Dixit. I refused to talk to him again, even though my father persisted in thinking I was bullheaded. “Don’t you think we would make sure his story checked out before marrying you off?” he said.

Sometimes, though, you get close, really close. A year ago, I was put in touch with a McKinsey consultant in Bombay whom I’ll call Sameer. I liked the fact that he was Indian-American but had returned to India to work. We had great conversations on the phone—among other things, he had interesting views on how people our age were becoming more sexually liberated in Indian cities—and I began envisioning myself kept in the finest silk saris. My father kept telling me he wanted it all “wrapped up” by February—it was only Christmas! Sameer had sent a picture, and while he wasn’t Shah Rukh Khan, he wasn’t bad.

Back for a break in New York, Sameer kindly came to see me in Brooklyn. We went to a French bistro, where he leaned over the table and said, “You know, your father really shouldn’t send out those photos of you. They don’t do justice to your beauty.” Sameer was generous, good-natured, engaging, seemingly besotted with me, on an expat salary—and also on the Atkins diet to lose 50 pounds. My Bombay dreams went up in smoke.

In this, I guess I am like every other woman in New York, complaining a man is too ambitious or not ambitious enough, too eager or not eager enough. But they are picky, too. These men, in their bid to fit in on Wall Street or on the golf course, would like a wife who is eminently presentable—to their boss, friends, and family. They would like a woman to be sophisticated enough to have a martini, and not a Diet Coke, at an office party, but, God forbid, not “sophisticated” enough to have three. Sometimes I worry that I’m a bit too sophisticated for most Indian men.

That’s not to say I haven’t come to appreciate what Indian men have to offer, which is a type of seriousness, a clarity of intent. I’ve never heard from an Indian man the New York beg-off phrase “I don’t think I’m ready for a relationship right now. I have a lot of things going on in my life.”

Indian men also seem to share my belief that Westerners have made the progression toward marriage unnecessarily agonizing. Neal, a 35-year-old Indian lawyer I know, thinks it’s absurd how a couple in America can date for years and still not know if they want to get married. “I think I would only need a couple of months to get to know a girl before I married her,” he says.

In more traditional arranged marriages—which are still very much alive and well in India—couples may get only one or two meetings before their wedding day. In America, and in big Indian cities, a couple may get a few months before they are expected to walk down the aisle, or around the fire, as they do seven times, in keeping with Hindu custom. By now I certainly think that would be enough time for me.

Other Indian women I know seem to be coming to the same conclusion. My friend Divya works the overnight shift at the BBC in London and stays out clubbing on her nights off. Imagine my surprise when I discovered she was on keralamatrimony.com, courtesy of her mother, who took the liberty of listing Divya’s hobbies as shopping and movies. (I was under the impression her hobbies were more along the lines of trance music and international politics.) Though she’s long favored pubgoing blokes, Divya, like me, doesn’t discount the possibility that the urologist from Trivandrum or the IT guy could just be the one—an idea patently unthinkable to us in our twenties.

It’s become second nature for women like us to straddle the two dating worlds. When I go out on a first date with an Indian man, I find myself saying things I would never utter to an American. Like, “I would expect my husband to fully share domestic chores.” Undeniably, there’s a lack of mystery to Indian-style dating, because both parties are fully aware of what the endgame should be. But with that also comes a certain relief.

With other forms of dating the options seem limitless. The long kiss in the bar with someone I’ve never met before could have been just that, an exchange that has a value and meaning of its own that can’t be quantified. Ditto for the one-night stand. (Try explaining that one to my parents.) The not-knowing-where-something-is-headed can be wildly exciting. It can also be a tad soul-crushing. Just ask any single woman in New York.

Indians of my mother’s generation—in fact, my mother herself—like to say of arranged marriage, “It’s not that there isn’t love. It’s just that it comes after the marriage.” I’m still not sure I buy it. But after a decade of Juan Carloses and short-lived affairs with married men and Craigslist flirtations and emotionally bankrupt boyfriends and, oddly, the most painful of all, the guys who just never call, it no longer seems like the most outlandish possibility.

Some of my single friends in New York say they’re still not convinced marriage is what they really want. I’m not sure I buy that, either. And no modern woman wants to close the door on any of her options—no matter how traditional—too hastily.

My friend Radhika, an unmarried 37-year-old photographer, used to hate going to her cousins’ weddings, where the aunties never asked her about the famines in Africa or the political conflict in Cambodia she’d covered. Instead it was, “Why aren’t you married? What are your intentions?” As much as she dreaded this, they’ve stopped asking, and for Radhika, that’s even worse. “It’s like they’ve written me off,” she says.

On a recent trip to India, I was made to eat dinner at the children’s table—they sent out for Domino’s pizza and Pepsis—because as an unmarried woman, I didn’t quite fit in with the adults. As much as I resented my exile, I realized that maybe I didn’t want to be eating vegetable curry and drinking rum with the grown-ups. Maybe that would have meant they’d given up on me, that they’d stopped viewing me as a not-yet-married girl but as an unmarriageable woman who’d ruined her youth by being too choosy and strong-headed.

This way, the aunties can still swing by the kids’ table as I’m sucking on a Pepsi and chucking a young cousin on the chin, and ask me, “When are you getting married? What are your intentions?” And I can say, “Auntie, do you have a boy in mind?”
Is Arranged Marriage Really Any Worse Than Craigslist?

Mysore Mallige Scandal - Wikipedia
2 minutes

The Hassan Mallige Scandal refers to a sex scandal in 2001 that involved the leaking of a home video made by a couple .This scandal broke out when the home video made by the couple themselves was leaked out by a friend of the boy involved.[1] Both the boy and the girl were students of an Malnad college of engineering. The words Mysore Mallige meaning the Jasmine (in Kannada) of Mysore is actually a double entendre because it originally refers to the flower variety by the same name.
History[edit source]

The video was filmed by the couple to capture their lovemaking. This footage leaked when the boy went to get the tape converted to a CD.[2] Later, one of the boy's friends who got hold of the footage and posted it on message boards on the internet under the name Mysore Mallige. Once the footage went viral, police investigation started and the boy who leaked it was identified and beaten up by the victim girl's family. After the video was widely circulated on CDs, the couple is believed to have fled to the U.S. There were also rumors of them having separated later.[3]
In popular culture[edit source]

Mysore Mallige became a very popular video and was widely discussed by scholars concerned with matters of cyberlaw, pornography, exhibitionism and voyeurism.[4] Bharath Murthy, a filmmaker, even made a documentary film that showcases different people's responses after having seen the clip. It is titled Jasmine of Mysore and was released in 2007. Since then, this incident has acquired a cult status.[5]

US: Armed protesters demand end to Michigan coronavirus lockdown
4 hours ago
3-4 minutes

Hundreds of angry protesters, some carrying firearms, gathered at Michigan’s State Capitol in Lansing on Thursday to protest against Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s request to extend the state of emergency to combat the coronavirus pandemic.

The protests came as state legislators debated a measure refusing the governor's request and voted to authorise a lawsuit challenging her authority and actions to combat the pandemic.

At one point during the legislative deliberations, dozens of protesters - many without face coverings and some with rifles slung around their chests - entered the Capitol and demanded to be let into the House chamber, which was closed to the public to allow room for representatives and reporters to spread apart. The crowd shouted, "Let us in" while mask-wearing sergeants and state police blocked them.

Demonstrators were allowed in the state Senate, which has fewer members and remained in session to also authorise legal action.

Firearms have been legally allowed in the Michigan state Capitol building for some time.

The protest appeared to be the largest in the state since April 15, when supporters and allies of President Donald Trump organised thousands of people for "Operation Gridlock", jamming the streets of Lansing with their cars to call out what they said was the overreach of Whitmer’s strict stay-at-home order.

It was one of the country’s first major anti-lockdown rallies and helped sparked a wave of similar events nationwide.

The slow reopening of state economies around the country has taken on political overtones, as Republican politicians and individuals affiliated with Trump’s re-election promoted protests in electoral battleground states such as Michigan.

"Governor Whitmer, and our state legislature, it’s over with. Open this state," Mike Detmer, a Republican candidate for US Congress told the crowd. "Let’s get businesses back open again. Let’s make sure there are jobs to go back to."

Other speakers at the "American Patriot Rally," which had different organisers to the mid-April protest, questioned the deadliness of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. They also said Whitmer’s stay-at-home order violated constitutional rights, and urged people to open their businesses on May 1 in disregard of her order.

Protesters, many from more rural parts of Michigan, have argued it has crippled the economy statewide even though the majority of deaths from the virus are centred on the southeastern Detroit metro area.

Whitmer's stay-at-home order, the strictest in the US, is in effect through May 15. House Republicans wanted changes, such as allowing elective medical and dental procedures again and certainty on the date she plans to reopen the economy on a regional basis. Meanwhile, the governor has allowed some businesses, such as lawn-care companies and greenhouses, to resume operating.

Many states, including Georgia, Oklahoma, Alaska, South Carolina and Ohio, have already moved to restart parts of their economies following weeks of mandatory lockdowns that have thrown nearly one in six American workers out of their jobs.

Interventions for Domestic Violence Offenders: Duluth Model


Evidence Ratings for Outcomes:
Effective - One Meta-Analysis 	Crime & Delinquency - Violent offenses
Promising - One Meta-Analysis 	Victimization - Domestic/intimate partner/family violence

Practice Description

Practice Goals/Practice Theory
There are a number of interventions that are common in the treatment of domestic violence offenders. One prominent clinical intervention employs a feminist psychoeducational approach and is widely known as the Duluth Model. Originating in 1981 from the Duluth Domestic Abuse Intervention Project in Duluth, Minnesota, this intervention proposes that the principal cause of domestic violence is a social and cultural, patriarchal ideology that historically has allowed men to control women through power and violence. Violence perpetrated on women and children originates from their relative positions of weakness and vulnerability socially, politically, economically, and culturally. As such, the model does not assume that domestic violence is caused by mental or behavioral health problems, substance use, anger, stress, or dysfunctional relationships. The program concentrates on providing group-facilitated exercises that challenge a male’s perception of entitlement to control and dominate his partner. The Duluth Model is considered less of a therapy and more of a psychoeducational program. This treatment technique focuses on providing an improved and broadened understanding of the causes and effects of the underlying problems experienced by the offender.

Practice Components
The Duluth Model makes use of the “Power and Control Wheel” as a tool to understand patterns of abusive behavior, including acts and threats of physical and sexual violence. The wheel includes the following eight items: 1) intimidation; 2) emotional abuse; 3) isolation; 4) economic abuse; 5) male privilege; 6) coercion and threats; 7) using children; and 8) minimizing, denying, and blaming. The wheel is designed to enable abusers to recognize the patterns of domestic violence rather than as isolated or cyclical acts. The goal of the intervention is to convince men to use nonviolent strategies outlined in the “Equality Wheel.” The eight items making up this wheel are 1) negotiation and fairness, 2) economic partnership, 3) shared responsibility, 4) responsible parenting, 5) honesty and accountability, 6) trust and support, 7) respect, and 8) non-threatening behavior. These items are considered to be the foundations of a strong and egalitarian relationship.

Target Populations
The Duluth Model focuses on male domestic violence perpetrators and female victims. Its theory is based on an understanding of male power, control, and dominance as culturally and historically pervasive and which allowed, if not encouraged, men to control women, sometimes using violence.

Additional Information
Another model of interventions targeted at domestic violence offenders is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (https://www.crimesolutions.gov/PracticeDetails.aspx?ID=16). There are a number of differences between interventions for domestic violence offenders that use CBT and interventions that use the Duluth Model. One main difference between the two types of interventions is in the theories underlying each. With CBT, violence is viewed as a learned behavior, which can be addressed by changing patterns of thinking and promoting and reinforcing nonviolent alternatives. The Duluth Model proposes that the principal cause of domestic violence is a social and cultural, patriarchal ideology that has allowed men to control women through power and violence. The model does not assume that domestic violence is caused by other issues such as mental or behavioral health problems. The Duluth Model focuses on changing offenders’ dominant and controlling behaviors, to foster more egalitarian relationships. In addition, CBT is a therapeutic approach, whereas the Duluth Model is viewed as psychoeducational programming (Babcock et al. 2004; Arias, Arce, and Vilariño 2013). However, the distinct differences between the two models are often unclear (Babcock et al. 2004).

There appears to be a consensus that the death of North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un is unlikely to trigger a Bitcoin sell-off 


Cover image via www.nytimes.com

On Apr. 25, reputable media outlets in Japan and China reported that North Korea’s dictator Kim Jong-un had passed away after a failed heart surgery.

While North Korea is yet to officially confirm the death of its supreme leader, the news sparked speculations about what the Hermit Kingdom would do with its enormous Bitcoin (BTC) stash.   
North Korea could trigger a market sell-off

The “Russian Market” Twitter account, which appears to be the poster child of Zero Hedge, stirred the discussion by suggesting that North Korea would sell off its BTC holdings in case of Kim’s death.
Novogratz says “buy Bitcoin”

Still, crypto Twitter took the tweet with a massive grain of salt. The fact that North Korea owns a lot of BTC doesn’t necessarily mean that it will start selling it because of Kim’s death, likening crypto to uranium and fish.

Meanwhile, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz simply replied “buy Bitcoin” in response to Anthony Pompliano’s tweet about the authoritarian leader.

HONG KONG — The beige van squatted outside of a Wuhan hospital, its side and back doors ajar. Fang Bin, a local clothing salesman, peered inside as he walked past. He groaned: “So many dead.” He counted five, six, seven, eight body bags. “This is too many.”  
That moment, in a 40-minute video about the coronavirus outbreak that has devastated China, propelled Mr. Fang to internet fame. Then, less than two weeks later, he disappeared.

Days earlier, another prominent video blogger in Wuhan, Chen Qiushi, had also gone missing. Mr. Chen’s friends and family said they believed he had been forcibly quarantined.

Before their disappearances, Mr. Fang and Mr. Chen had recorded dozens of videos from Wuhan, streaming unfiltered and often heartbreaking images from the center of the outbreak. Long lines outside hospitals. Feeble patients. Agonized relatives.

The footage would have been striking anywhere. But it was especially so coming from inside China, where even mild criticism of the authorities is quickly scrubbed from the online record, and those responsible for it often punished.

The appetite for the videos reflects, in part, the shortage of independent news sources in China, where professional newspapers are tightly controlled by the authorities. Earlier this month, the state propaganda department deployed hundreds of journalists to reshape the narrative of t

But the videos also reflected the growing call for free speech in China in recent weeks, as the coronavirus crisis has prompted criticism and introspection from unexpected corners across the country.

Several professional news organizations have produced incisive reports on the outbreak. A revolt against government censorship broke out on Chinese social media last week after the death of Li Wenliang, the Wuhan doctor who had tried to warn of the virus before officials had acknowledged an outbreak.

Mr. Fang’s and Mr. Chen’s videos were another manifestation of the dissatisfaction that the government’s handling of the outbreak has unleashed among ordinary Chinese citizens.

“When suddenly there’s a crisis, they want to have access to a wider array of content and reporting,” said Sarah Cook, who studies Chinese media at Freedom House, a pro-democracy research group based in the United States.

The disappearance of the two men also underscores that the ruling Communist Party has no intention of loosening its grip on free speech.

China’s leader, Xi Jinping, said last month that officials needed to “strengthen the guidance of public opinion.” While Chinese social media has overflowed with fear and grief, state propaganda outlets have emphasized Mr. Xi’s steady hand, framed the fight against the outbreak as a form of patriotism and shared upbeat videos of medical workers dancing.

More than 350 people across China have been punished for “spreading rumors” about the outbreak, according to Chinese Human Rights Defenders, an advocacy group.

Mr. Chen, a fast-talking, fresh-faced lawyer from eastern China, was already well-known online before the outbreak. He traveled to Hong Kong during the pro-democracy protests last year and disputed the Chinese authorities’ depiction of the demonstrators as a riotous mob.

The Beijing authorities summoned him back to the mainland and deleted his social media accounts, Mr. Chen told his followers later.

But when the coronavirus led officials to seal off Wuhan last month, he raced to the city of 11 million, citing his duty as a self-declared citizen journalist. “What sort of a journalist are you if you don’t dare rush to the front line?” he said.

In his videos, which drew millions of views on YouTube, Mr. Chen interviewed locals who had lost loved ones, filmed a woman breaking down as she waited for care and visited an exhibition center that had been converted into a quarantine center.

He was blocked from WeChat, a major Chinese social media app, for spreading rumors. But he was adamant that he shared only what he himself had seen or heard.

As time went on, Mr. Chen, usually energetic, began to show strain. “I am scared,” he said on Jan. 30. “In front of me is the virus. Behind me is China’s legal and administrative power.”

The authorities had contacted his parents to ask for his whereabouts, he said. He teared up suddenly. Then, his finger pointing at the camera, he blurted: “I’m not even scared of death. You think I’m scared of you, Communist Party?”

On Feb. 6, Mr. Chen’s friends lost contact with him. Xu Xiaodong, a prominent mixed martial arts practitioner and a friend of Mr. Chen, posted a video on Feb. 7 saying that Mr. Chen’s parents had been told that their son had been quarantined, though he had not shown symptoms of illness.

Unlike Mr. Chen, Mr. Fang, the clothing salesman, was fairly anonymous before the coronavirus outbreak. Much of his YouTube activity had involved producing enthusiastic videos about traditional Chinese clothing.

But as the outbreak escalated, he began sharing videos of Wuhan’s empty streets and crowded hospitals. They lacked the slickness of Mr. Chen’s dispatches, which were often subtitled and tightly edited. But, as with Mr. Chen’s videos, they showed a man growing increasingly desperate — and defiant.

On Feb. 2, Mr. Fang described how officials had confiscated his laptop and interrogated him about his footage of the body bags. On Feb. 4, he filmed a group of people outside his home, who said they were there to ask him questions. He turned them away, daring them to break down his door.

In his final videos, Mr. Fang turned explicitly political in a way rarely heard inside China, at least in public. Filming from inside his home — he said he was surrounded by plainclothes policemen — he railed against “greed for power” and “tyranny.”

His last video, on Feb. 9, was just 12 seconds long. It featured a scroll of paper with the words, “All citizens resist, hand power back to the people.”

Despite the worldwide audience for Mr. Fang’s and Mr. Chen’s videos, it is hard to know how much reach they had domestically, said Fang Kecheng, an assistant professor of journalism at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Both men relied heavily on YouTube and Twitter, which are blocked in China.

But unlike the torrent of grief and anger online in response to the death of Dr. Li, news of Mr. Chen’s and Mr. Fang’s disappearances has been swiftly stamped out on Chinese social media. Their names returned almost no results on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like platform, on Friday.

Still, Ms. Cook said the power of Mr. Chen’s and Mr. Fang’s videos, as well as the reporting done by professional journalists in Wuhan, should not be underestimated.

She pointed to the Chinese authorities’ decision this week to loosen diagnostic requirements for coronavirus cases, leading to a significant jump in reported infections, as evidence of their impact.

That decision might not have come “if you didn’t have all these people in Wuhan sending out reports that what you’re hearing is an underestimate,” Ms. Cook said. “These very courageous individuals can, in unusual circumstances, push back and force the state’s hand.”

Mr. Fang, in one of his last videos, seemed struck by a similar sentiment. He thanked his viewers, who he said had been calling him nonstop to send support.

“A person, just an ordinary person, a silly person,” he said of himself, “who lifted the lid for a second.”

The Coronavirus Outbreak
Frequently Asked Questions and Advice
Updated April 11, 2020

When will this end?
This is a difficult question, because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report, Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.

How can I help?
The Times Neediest Cases Fund has started a special campaign to help those who have been affected, which accepts donations here. Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30,000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal, though.)

What should I do if I feel sick?
If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.

Should I wear a mask?
The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.

How do I get tested?
If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.

How does coronavirus spread?
It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.

Is there a vaccine yet?
No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.

What makes this outbreak so different?
Unlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard.

What if somebody in my family gets sick?
If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible, according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently.

Should I stock up on groceries?
Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves, the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.

Can I go to the park?
Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.

Should I pull my money from the markets?
That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.

What should I do with my 401(k)?
Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.”

'Caretaking and heartbreaking': The remarkable story of the man who fosters terminally ill children | IMAGE.ie
https://www.image.ie/life/ill-156982
Amanda Cassidy
5-6 minutes

Mohamed Bzeek describes his actions as his life's mission. The 65-year-old former Libyan immigrant has dedicated his life to taking in the children who have nobody else in their final weeks on this earth.

Over 40 years ago, Bzeek arrived in the US to study electronic engineering. He married his late wife and became a citizen in 1997. The widower now lives in Los Angeles where he is one of the only foster parents who cares exclusively for terminally ill children. His story made headlines last year when the LA Times ran a story about his work.

    "Ten children lost their lives in my arms."

He was awarded the International Benevolence Award by the Diyanet Foundation and his life has just been made into a documentary directed by Ensar Altay.

"In 1995, we decided to adopt orphans left at hospitals or taken from their families by the state because of violence and pressure" explained Bzeek who was once a marathon runner before he came to America. "The only house that accepts orphans and children who are about to die in Los Angeles is my house. I have dealt with 80 children since 1989. Ten children lost their lives in my arms."
Safe and loved

The Department of Child Services in LA work closely with Bzeek. "They tell me when children are about to die and ask if I can adopt them. They know that I do not hesitate to accept. If I don't, they are sent to hospitals and don't have a family or house. However, when I take them, they feel a family atmosphere. They feel safe and are loved until the end of their lives."

In many cases, he gives the children names as well as shelter and love. “In the hospital, they give birth, they leave them,” Bzeek said in an interview with the LA hospital. “Their families don’t name them. It comes on the paper: ‘Baby boy,’ ‘Baby girl.’ I name them. I give them names.”

Sophie Keefer works in paediatric palliative care. She recently met with Mohamed and wrote about her experience for the International Children's Palliative Care Network.

"He was a bear of a man with a long beard and a soft smile." Sophie wrote. "His foster daughter was propped up on the couch. When Mohamed went to hold this small, fragile, girl he warned me that she occasionally has seizures and if I was holding her while this happened, to just keep holding her and it would quickly pass. I appreciated how calm and matter of fact the conversation was, allowing me to hold her with confidence, prepared for whatever her body would do.

She’d had an encephalocele which meant that at birth part of her brain protruded through an opening in her skull. She cannot see, hear, speak or move. She can, however, feel and respond to touch. When you stroke her gently she relaxes and as you cradle her body, it moves in sync with yours".

Bzeek took in the little girl when she was just seven weeks old. He was told she would only live a few months. Today she is six years old. The county took her from her biological parents. His own biological son Adam (19) was born with the challenges of brittle bones and dwarfism. He has broken almost every bone in his body at some stage.

Bzeek says caring for those who are so ill is a painful process. He knows their time together is precious. "I know it's heartbreak. I know it's a lot of work and I know it's going to hurt me sometimes. You know, I feel sad. But, in my opinion, we should help each other, you know?"

Sophie says that Mohamed cooked for her in his immaculate kitchen and spoke more about religion and the importance it plays in his own life. "I've been told that my story has touched others and built their belief in humanity again - that it's changed their perspective of Muslim-Americans. I like to think of it as true Islam, it is about love and compassion and sympathy for others. If I can help somebody, I have to help."

For the past three years, Mohammed works with a nurse who comes everyday so he can take small breaks, run errands and pray at his mosque. After the LA Times article, he received a lot of media attention.  One online commenter called Bzeek the Muslim Mother Teresa, another opened a GoFundMe account on his behalf; he didn’t learn of it until the company contacted him. The donations will be a boost to the $1,600 a month he gets from L.A. County. He plans to put the money toward some essential home improvement, starting with installing air conditioning.

Now, he has his own health problems. Last year doctors told him he had stage-2 colon cancer. In an interview with the LA children's hospital, he described his reaction to the news. “I had no family with me and I was scared,” he says. “I felt the same what the kids feel. They are alone. If I am 62 and I am scared, what about them?”

 Mohamed Bzeek: Fostering Humanity
January 4, 2020 | 2 min read

When Mohamed Bzeek admitted himself to a hospital for colon cancer, he was petrified. Without family members to accompany him to his operation, he was afraid to face his uncertain fate alone. Mohamed’s experience in the hospital made him realize, all over again, why he chooses to foster children who are terminally ill: so that they can feel like they’re a part of a loving and supportive family – like every human deserves.
For over 20 years, Mohamed Bzeek has been taking in foster children who are exclusively sick or terminally ill. Mohamed’s inspiration comes from his late wife Dawn, a former foster mother and advocate for better foster care. Before she passed away in 2014, Dawn and Mohamed were on a first name basis with Los Angeles County’s Department of Children and Family Services, since they were the only people who would willingly care for sick children. Today, Mohamed honors Dawn’s legacy by providing a loving home for terminally ill foster children. Most recently, Mohamed has taken in a young girl who suffers from a rare brain condition. She’s blind, deaf, and paralyzed in her arms and legs. He says, “The only way to communicate with her is by touch, and so I hold her. I want her to know that somebody is here for her. Somebody loves her. She is not alone.” Mohamed also cares for his biological son, Adam, who was born with dwarfism and osteogenesis impefecta (brittle bone disease). Watch the video above to see how Mohamed has devoted his life to caring for Adam and the rest of his foster children – all of whom he loves the same.

Mohamed Bzeek has become somewhat of a local hero in Los Angeles, taking on a life mission that few others would consider: as a foster parent who cares solely for terminally ill children. Special correspondent Gayle Tzemach Lemmon meets Bzeek, a former Libyan immigrant who depends on his Muslim faith as he juggles intensive caretaking and heartbreak, as well as his own battle with cancer.

'I know they are going to die.' This foster father takes in only terminally ill children'
By Hailey Branson-PottsStaff Writer
11-14 minutes

The children were going to die.
Mohamed Bzeek knew that. But in his more than two decades as a foster father, he took them in anyway — the sickest of the sick in Los Angeles County’s sprawling foster care system.

He has buried about 10 children. Some died in his arms.

Now, Bzeek spends long days and sleepless nights caring for a bedridden 6-year-old foster girl with a rare brain defect. She’s blind and deaf. She has daily seizures. Her arms and legs are paralyzed.

Bzeek, a quiet, devout Libyan-born Muslim who lives in Azusa, just wants her to know she’s not alone in this life. 

“I know she can’t hear, can’t see, but I always talk to her,” he said. “I’m always holding her, playing with her, touching her. … She has feelings. She has a soul. She’s a human being.”

    He’s the only one that would take a child who would possibly not make it.

Melissa Testerman, Department of Children and Family Services intake coordinator

Of the 35,000 children monitored by the county’s Department of Children and Family Services, there are about 600 children at any given time who fall under the care of the department’s Medical Case Management Services, which serves those with the most severe medical needs, said Rosella Yousef, an assistant regional administrator for the unit. 

There is a dire need for foster parents to care for such children. 

And there is only one person like Bzeek. 

“If anyone ever calls us and says, ‘This kid needs to go home on hospice,’ there’s only one name we think of,” said Melissa Testerman, a DCFS intake coordinator who finds placements for sick children. “He’s the only one that would take a child who would possibly not make it.”

Typically, she said, children with complex conditions are placed in medical facilities or with nurses who have opted to become foster parents. 

But Bzeek is the only foster parent in the county known to take in terminally ill children, Yousef said. Though she knows the single father is stretched thin caring for the girl, who requires around-the-clock care, Yousef still approached him at a department Christmas party in December and asked if he could possibly take in another sick child.

This time, Bzeek politely declined.
Bzeek is a quiet, religious man who wants his foster daughter to know she’s not alone in this life.

The girl sits propped up with pillows in the corner of Bzeek’s living room couch. She has long, thin brown hair pulled into a ponytail and perfectly arched eyebrows over unseeing gray eyes.

Because of confidentiality laws, the girl is not being identified. But a special court order allowed The Times to spend time at Bzeek’s home and to interview people involved in his foster daughter’s case.

The girl’s head is too small for her 34-pound body, which is too small for her age. She was born with an encephalocele, a rare malformation in which part of her brain protruded through an opening in her skull, according to Dr. Suzanne Roberts, the girl’s pediatrician at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. Neurosurgeons removed the protruding brain tissue shortly after her birth, but much of her brain remains undeveloped. 

She has been in Bzeek’s care since she was a month old. Before her, he cared for three other children with the same condition. 

“These kids, it’s a life sentence for them,” he said.  

Bzeek, 62, is a portly man with a long, dark beard and a soft voice. The oldest of 10 children, he came to this country from Libya as a college student in 1978.

Years later, through a mutual friend, he met a woman named Dawn, who would become his wife. She had become a foster parent in the early 1980s, before she met Bzeek. Her grandparents had been foster parents, and she was inspired by them, Bzeek said. Before she met Bzeek, she opened her home as an emergency shelter for foster children who needed immediate placement or who were placed in protective custody. 

    The key is, you have to love them like your own.

Mohamed Bzeek

Dawn Bzeek fell in love with every child she took in. She took them to professional holiday photo sessions, and she organized Christmas gift donation drives for foster children.  

She was funny, Bzeek said during a recent drive home from the hospital. She was absolutely terrified of spiders and bugs, so much that even Halloween decorations creeped her out — but she was never scared by the children’s illnesses or the possibility that she would die, Bzeek said.  

The Bzeeks opened their Azusa home to dozens of children. They taught classes on foster parenting — and how to handle a child’s illness and death — at community colleges. Dawn Bzeek was such a highly regarded foster mother that her name appeared on statewide task forces for improving foster care alongside doctors and policymakers. 

Bzeek started caring for foster children with Dawn in 1989, he said. Often, the children were ill.

Mohamed Bzeek first experienced the death of a foster child in 1991. She was the child of a farm worker who was pregnant when she breathed in toxic pesticides sprayed by crop dusters. She was born with a spinal disorder, wore a full body cast and wasn’t yet a year old when she died on July 4, 1991, as the Bzeeks prepared dinner.

“This one hurt me so badly when she died,” Bzeek said, glancing at a photograph of a tiny girl in a frilly white dress, lying in a coffin surrounded by yellow flowers. 

By the mid-1990s, the Bzeeks decided to specifically care for terminally ill children who had do-not-resuscitate orders because no one else would take them in.

There was the boy with short-gut syndrome who was admitted to the hospital 167 times in his eight-year life. He could never eat solid food, but the Bzeeks would sit him at the dinner table, with his own empty plate and spoon, so he could sit with them as a family. 

There was the girl with the same brain condition as Bzeek’s current foster daughter, who lived for eight days after they brought her home. She was so tiny that when she died a doll maker made an outfit for her funeral. Bzeek carried her coffin in his hands like a shoe box.

“The key is, you have to love them like your own,” Bzeek said recently. “I know they are sick. I know they are going to die. I do my best as a human being and leave the rest to God.” 
“I know she can’t hear, can’t see, but I always talk to her,” Mohamed Bzeek says.

“I know she can’t hear, can’t see, but I always talk to her,” Mohamed Bzeek says.

(Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)

Bzeek’s only biological son, Adam, was born in 1997 — with brittle bone disease and dwarfism. He was a child so fragile that changing his diaper or his socks could break his bones.

Bzeek said he was never angry about his own son’s disabilities. He loved him all the same. 

“That’s the way God created him,” Bzeek said. 

Now 19, Adam weighs about 65 pounds and has big brown eyes and a shy grin. When at home, he gets around the house on a body skateboard that his father made for him out of a miniature ironing board, zooming across the wood floor, steering with his hands. 

Adam studies computer science at Citrus College, driving his electric wheelchair to class. He’s the smallest student in class, Bzeek said, “but he’s a fighter.” 

Adam’s parents never glossed over how sick his foster siblings were, and they told him the children were going to eventually die, Bzeek said. They accepted death as part of life — something that made the small joys of living all the more meaningful. 

“I love my sister,” the shy teenager said of the foster girl. “Nobody should have to go through so much pain.”

About 2000, Dawn Bzeek, once such an active advocate for foster children, became ill. She suffered from powerful seizures that would leave her weak for days. She could hardly leave the house because she didn’t want to collapse in public.

The frustrations of her illness wore on her, Bzeek said. There was stress in the marriage, and she and Bzeek split in 2013. She died a little over a year later.  

Bzeek chokes up when he talks about her. When it came to facing the difficulties of the children’s illnesses, the knowledge that they would die, she was always the stronger one, he said.   

:::

On a chilly November morning, Bzeek pushed the girl’s wheelchair and the IV pole that carries her feeding formula into Children’s Hospital on Sunset Boulevard. She was wrapped in a soft pink blanket, her head resting on a pillow with the stitched words: “Dad is like duct tape holding our home together.” 

The temperatures had been bouncing up and down that week, and the girl had a cold. Her brain cannot fully regulate her body temperature, so one leg was hot while the other was cold.  

On the elevator, her face glowed bright red as she coughed, her throat filled with phlegm, screaming for air. People in the elevator looked away.

Bzeek rubbed her cheek playfully and held her hand, waving it playfully. “Heeeey, mama,” he cooed in her ear, calming her down.

For Bzeek, the hospital has become a second home. When he’s not here, he’s often on the phone with her many doctors, the insurers who fight over who’s paying for it all, the lawyers who represent her and her social workers. Any time they leave the house together, he carries a thick black binder filled with her medical records and pages of medications.

Still, Bzeek —  who had to be licensed through the county to care for medically fragile children and receives about $1,700 a month for her care — is not able to make medical decisions for her.

Roberts entered the exam room, smiling at the girl’s frilly socks and brown dress with fall-colored leaves.

“There’s our princess,” the doctor said. “She’s in her pretty dress, as always.”

Roberts has known Bzeek for years and has seen many of his foster children. By the time this girl was age 2, Roberts said, doctors said there were no more interventions to improve her condition.

“Nobody ever wants to give up,” she said. “But we had run through the options.”

But the girl, who is hooked to feeding and medication tubes at least 22 hours a day, has lived as long as she has because of Bzeek, the doctor said.

“When she’s not sick and in a good mood, she’ll cry to be held,” Roberts said. “She’s not verbal, but she can make her needs known. … Her life is not complete suffering. She has moments where she’s enjoying herself and she’s pretty content, and it’s all because of Mohamed.”

Other than trips to the hospital and Friday prayers at the mosque — when the day nurse watches her — Bzeek rarely leaves the house.

To avoid choking, the girl sleeps sitting up. Bzeek sleeps on a second couch next to hers. He doesn’t sleep much.

:::

On a Saturday in early December, Bzeek, Adam and the girl’s nurse, Marilou Terry, had a celebratory lunch for the child’s sixth birthday. He invited her biological parents. They didn’t come. 

Bzeek crouched in front of the girl — wearing a long, red-and-white dress and matching socks — and held her hands, clapping them together. 

“Yay!” he said, cheerfully. “You are 6! 6! 6!” 

Bzeek lit six birthday candles in a cheesecake and sat the girl on the kitchen table, holding the cake near her face so she could feel the warmth of the flames.

As they sang “Happy Birthday,” Bzeek leaned over her left shoulder, his beard gently brushing the side of her face. She smelled the smoke, and a small smile crossed her face.

Emotions are cognitive, not innate, researchers conclude 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor%27s_fallacy
The prosecutor's fallacy is a fallacy of statistical reasoning typically used by a prosecutor to exaggerate the likelihood of a criminal defendant's guilt. The fallacy can be used to support other claims as well – including the innocence of a defendant. The following claim demonstrates the fallacy in the context of a prosecutor questioning an expert witness: “the odds of finding this evidence on an innocent man are so small that the jury can safely disregard the possibility that this defendant is innocent”.[1] The claim obscures that the likelihood of the defendant's innocence, given the evidence found on him, in fact depends on the likely quite high prior odds of the defendant being a random innocent person – as well as the stated low odds of finding the evidence on such a random innocent person, not to mention the underlying high odds that the evidence is indeed indicative of guilt.

There is no fourth world. The term third world doesn't represent backwardness. It's just a term that represents the nations that were not part of the cold war. The two problems that you'll read below are far too utopian, way ahead of even the first worlds.

Generally, it's very hard to think that 'fewer people dying' could ever be a problem. In India, ever since the lock down, there have been fewer cases of road accidents, and deaths from substance abuse, and even strokes.

On the other hand, in Florida, there have been fewer murders (none, to be exact), which makes me think if V.I.K.I. from the movie "I, Robot" was right after all?

V.I.K.I. determined that humans were a threat to themselves and rationalized that the only way to prevent humanity from destroying themselves was by putting them under restraint, locking them down in a curfew. Sonny, the other robot that was programmed to override "the three-laws", to be a subversive, a renegade deems V.I.K.I.'s rationalization, though well-intentioned, was "too heartless".

    While death rates in some countries have risen sharply in recent weeks, in India the opposite seems to be happening
    India's lower death rates stands in contrast to what has been seen elsewhere

Parts of India have recorded dramatic falls in mortality rates after a nationwide lockdown was imposed to fight the new coronavirus, suggesting there has not been an undetected surge in virus-related deaths. All over the world, mortality rates are being scrutinised to determine the true impact of the coronavirus, which emerged in China late last year and is known to have infected more than 2.7 million people globally, with nearly 190,000 deaths.

While death rates in some countries have risen sharply in recent weeks, in India the opposite seems to be happening, at least in some places, leaving hospitals, funeral parlours and cremation sites wondering what is going on.

"It's very surprising for us," said Shruthi Reddy, chief executive officer of Anthyesti Funeral Services, which operates in of Kolkata and Bengaluru.

The company handled about five jobs a day in January but has only had about three a day this month.

"We've declared employee pay cuts if revenue falls below a threshold," Reddy said.

Other numbers tell a similar story.

Central Mumbai, home to some 12 million people, saw deaths fall by about 21% in March compared with the same month of 2019, according to municipal data.

Overall deaths plummeted 67% in Ahmedabad over the same period.

Data from at least two other cities, along with accounts from state health officials, show a similar pattern. Half a dozen funeral businesses and crematoriums also reported slumps in business, especially in April.

"If we're not seeing an increase in deaths, the suspicion that there may be more COVID-19 fatalities out there is not true," said Giridhar Babu, professor of epidemiology at the Public Health Foundation of India.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed a lockdown of India's 1.3 billion people on March 25 in a bid to stop the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected some 23,077 people, killing 718 of them, according to the latest figures.

India has tested about 525,000 people, meaning some 4% were positive. In the United Sates, about 18% of tests are positive, according to the COVID Tracking project.

India's apparently lower death rates stands in contrast to what has been seen elsewhere.

The Netherlands recorded about 2,000 more deaths than normal in the first week of April, for example, while in Indonesia's capital of Jakarta the number of funerals rose sharply in March.

Some towns in Italy also saw a jump in recorded deaths.

Indian doctors, officials and crematorium employees suspect the lower death rate is in large part attributable to fewer road and rail accidents.

"Road accident cases, and even patients with alcohol or drug abuse, stroke and heart attacks have been coming in fewer numbers," said Dr Himanta Biswa Sarma, health minister for Assam.

Accidents on India's chaotic roads killed more than 151,400 people in 2018, according to official data, the world's highest absolute number.

The coronavirus lockdown, which is due to end on May 3, will cut road deaths by at least 15% this year compared with 2018, Paresh Kumar Goel, a director at the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, said.

With passenger trains halted, fatalities from all-too-common rail accidents have also plunged. In Mumbai alone, for example, more than half a dozen people typically die every day on the rail network.

Neeraj Kumar, who is in charge of a crematorium on the banks of the holy Ganges river in Uttar Pradesh, said victims of crime were also not being brought in.

"We used to get at least 10 accident-related bodies every day and many related to murder cases. But after the lockdown we're only receiving natural death cases," Kumar said.

The site used to perform up to 30 cremations a day but in the month since March 22, only 43 people had been cremated, Kumar said after leafing through the crematorium's record book.

But the lower rates might also reflect difficulties in reporting deaths during the lockdown, officials said.

"There could be an increase when the lockdown ends," said Dr Bhavin Joshi, a senior health department official with the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation.

Requests for India-wide data from the national registrar went unanswered, while an official at the New Delhi Municipal Council said they could not provide numbers.

Reuters was also unable to obtain data for West Bengal, where some doctors have accused the government of understating coronavirus deaths.

Only a state-appointed committee is allowed to declare that a patient has died from the virus.

MIAMI (CNN) — For the first time since 1957, the city of Miami went at least seven weeks without a single murder.

The city did not report a homicide from Feb. 17 to April 12.

The Miami Police Department released the statistics this week.

While ‘stay at home’ orders are playing a role, the police chief says the trend started in mid-February before social distancing was put in place.

Miami police say other crimes have also decreased in the area.

India’s crorepati club continues to swell, 97,689 disclose income above Rs 1 crore
2-3 minutes

NEW DELHI: India’s crorepati club has swelled, with as many as 97,689 showing incomes above Rs 1 crore in assessment year 2018-19, according to data from the Income Tax Department, released on Friday. This is 20% growth from the year before, when the number was 81,344.

This income reported for assessment year 2018-19 relates to fiscal 2017-18, the financial year immediately after demonetisation and when the economy began to slow.

In the salaried category, 49,128 people declared incomes above a crore in AY 2018-19, compared with 41,457 the previous year.

The income tax released time-series data updated up to fiscal year 2018-19 and income-distribution data for AY 2018-19, including income distribution information of corporates, Hindu Undivided Families and individuals. The total number of tax payers declaring income above Rs 1 crore rose to 1.67 lakh in AY 2018-19 from 1.33 lakh in AY2017-18, a rise of 19%. The number of individuals paying income tax above Rs 1 crore rose to 16,759 from 14,068.

As many as 2.62 crore filed returns with no income, while another nearly 82 lakh declared income ranging from Rs 5.5 lakh to Rs 9.5 lakh.

As per the current income tax slab, annual income up to Rs 2.5 lakh faces no income tax. Income between Rs 2.5 lakh and up to Rs 5 lakh is taxed at 5% and that above Rs 10 lakh at 30%-plus.

The income tax department begun extensive use of data post the demonetisation announced on November 8, 2016. Data from bank deposits made during the period were used to nab those who were not declaring true incomes, which the department claims led to increase in compliance. About 6.21 crore returns were filed up to December 2018. These included returns for past assessment years that taxpayers filed to comply.

As many as 2,085 individuals declared income from house property above Rs 1 crore in assessment year 2018-19. There is a substantial jump in individuals declaring long-term capital gains of over a crore — to 8,629 individuals against 6,750 in AY 2017-18.

In the case of firms, the number of those declaring income above Rs 1 crore rose to 17,320 in AY 2018-19 from 12,990 the year before.

Spandan Bhattacharya:
When it comes to welfare and open borders, Caplan has showed us that Milton Friedman was wrong when he said that immigration and an welfare state don't go together.
Even otherwise, we could limit welfare to new immigrants, avoiding the debate entirely.
However, even if the open border enthusiasts were wrong and there indeed was an economic problem with immigration, one should rather scale down on the welfare state than on open borders.
People have an inalienable right to not be the victims of discrimination on the basis of their place of birth, and no welfare state and no nothing should come in the way of that.

Meghna Saha
We are very very far from stopping the welfare systems. In fact the world is shifting more and more towards welfare systems. In the upcoming era, because of data driven approach, govt will be able to plan the welfare much smartly and monitor the outcome in real time. Hence it will be more popular over the time.
The welfare issue for immigrants get largely solved if you give them just work visa with healthcare.

Venkata Krishnan
I thoroughly agree..immigrants coming here from persecution must be sheltered and taken care of after proper security protocols without any discrimination basis... irrespective of economic woes...in any case chuthiya politicians loot on crores..not even a tiny portion will be needed for basic needs of these people
I think government must focus on drafting a comprehensive population control bill in staggered implementation basis... immigrants coming either from persecution of for better economic expectations are not even meagre portion compared to rate of explosion of our citizens

Author's comments:
When in a nation, majority of taxes comes from indirect sources, a lower economic group of consumers will continue to bear the load & contribute their fair share of taxes simply by subsisting & buying consumer goods and other services.
Sometimes, I feel that the nations want people to remain "poor" (who can subsist themselves, as well as can buy the aforementioned).
The welfare system is there to ensure that this pool of tax payers survive 
It's easy to sell the idea that the welfare system is a burden on the direct taxpayers. It is not true.
There have been a handful of cases where welfare was abused beyond reasonable limits and they're often highlighted in campaigns.

But on the other hand I feel, this welfare system may turn people to rely heavily on the government. During Colonnial times, salaries given to coolies (within india) were carefully calculated to allow subsistence. Nothing more.

New Delhi: Raising income tax rate to 40 per cent for those who earn over Rs 1 crore a year, re-introduction of wealth tax, effecting a one-time Covid-19 cess of 4 per cent on taxable income of over Rs 10 lakh, direct cash transfer of up to Rs 5,000 a month for the poor, a three-year tax holiday for all corporates and businesses in the healthcare sector — these are some of the recommendations made by over 50 officers of the Indian Revenue Service (IRS) to help the economy recover from the lockdown.

The recommendations are part of a policy paper titled “Fiscal Options & Response to Covid-19 Epidemic (FORCE), which the IRS Association presented to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and the Union Finance Ministry Saturday, sources in the organisation said. It has also been sent to the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), the sources added.

The paper, a copy of which is with ThePrint, delves into several steps the officers think are needed to revive the economy, by raising additional revenue without burdening the common man.

“The government needs to spend considerably more to revive the economy and it needs to raise additional revenue, but in ways that must not burden the already distressed common man,” the paper says. “In times like these, the so-called ‘super-rich’ have a higher obligation towards ensuring the larger public good.”

Tax the rich, paper argues

To this effect, the paper recommends raising the highest income tax slab rate, for total income levels above Rs 1 crore, to 40 per cent, or re-introduction of the wealth tax for those with a net wealth of Rs 5 crore or more.

“The government can then identify 5-10 most crucial projects or schemes entailing significant expenditure, which are likely to have a decisive impact on reviving the economy. The government should commit itself to the fact that the additional revenue raised through taxing the wealthy will only and only be utilised for these 5-10 projects or schemes,” the paper argues.

The paper also recommends an additional one-time cess of 4 per cent on account of Covid-19 relief, to be levied on those with a taxable income of more than Rs 10 lakh. The extra revenue generated through this could be between Rs 15,000 to Rs 18,000 crore, the officers estimate.

There should also be mobilisation of CSR funds for Covid-19 relief by extending tax incentives. Corporates, the officers argue, may be allowed to treat the salaries paid to their non-managerial staff during the Covid-19 crisis as part of their obligation under CSR, in order to incentivise continued wages during non-working days.

The paper also recommends a new tax-saving scheme, for example, a Covid-19 savings certificate, in order to mobilise more funds.

‘Increase equalisation levy for e-commerce firms’

The paper states that since the coronavirus economy is largely a digital/online/e-commerce one, the tax imposed on online companies such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Zoom, among others, under the equalisation levy or “Google Tax” can be increased from 6 per cent to 7 per cent for their ad services, and from 2 per cent to 3 per cent for e-commerce work.

“The equalisation levy collection for FY 2017-18 was Rs 550 crore and FY 2018-19 was Rs 939 crore,” the paper states. “Going by the growth of business in the sector, the said increase in rate is likely to contribute a good amount of increased revenue. Moreover, since the levy is not part of the Income Tax Act, it would not be subject to the provision of India’s income tax treaties.”

‘Ensure DBT for the poor’

On the expenditure front, the paper suggests a direct cash transfer of Rs 3,000 to Rs 5,000 a month for the most economically disadvantaged 12 crore households over a period of at least six months.

It also argues that the crisis offers an opportunity to expand MGNREGA and make public works programmes such as building of rural roads, public health infrastructure, primary school buildings and the like the focus of the scheme.

“If envisioned and implemented in a targeted fashion, the scheme continues to hold tremendous promise, and can achieve three prized objectives together: provision of income support through employment for the jobless, creation of public infrastructure, and investment in human capital,” the paper recommends.

‘Let healthcare sector drive economy’

The paper also states that the government should ensure the health sector serves as the driving force for economic growth for the next year or so.

“From a taxation perspective, a complete tax holiday or tax break is proposed for the next three years for all corporates, firms and businesses operating in the healthcare sector,” it states. “The scope can have an exclusive definition, and must incorporate manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, medical grade masks, gloves, gowns, ventilators, testing labs, construction contractors involved in building of hospitals/primary health centers, etc.”

‘Steps to boost consumption’

In order to boost consumption and increase disposable income, the paper recommends measures such as allowing short-term capital loss suffered by retail investors due to the recent stock market slump to be set off from their salary, that is, sparing them any tax liability on the money lost.

It also wants the government to not consider bonuses or any other allowances given to employees with an annual pay of less than Rs 10 lakh as taxable income, to allow the deferral of tax payment by individuals who have lost their jobs for six months or until they find a new job, and providing increased deduction interests over the purchase of houses, automobiles, and electronic items that are made in India.

The paper also makes a slew of recommendations to boost the MSME sector, which, it argues, is bound to be the worst-hit by the crisis. These include a tax moratorium for MSMEs whose total tax liability is less than Rs 5 crore-10 for one year.

1488 / General Hate Symbols / Numeric Hate Symbols
Alternate Names: 8814
1488 is a combination of two popular white supremacist numeric symbols. The first symbol is 14, which is shorthand for the "14 Words" slogan: "We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children." The second is 88, which stands for "Heil Hitler" (H being the 8th letter of the alphabet). Together, the numbers form a general endorsement of white supremacy and its beliefs. As such, they are ubiquitous within the white supremacist movement - as graffiti, in graphics and tattoos, even in screen names and e-mail addresses, such as aryanprincess1488@hate.net.  Some white supremacists will even price racist merchandise, such as t-shirts or compact discs, for $14.88. The symbol is most commonly written as 1488 or 14/88, but variations such as 14-88 or 8814 are also common

South Korean security brass see no signs Kim Jong Un not in charge

○ CNN apologizes for using actor's photo in Kim Jong Un story
○ Dennis Rodman says he's praying for Kim Jong Un: 'I hope it's just a rumor'
○ Top US general says no reason to believe Kim Jong Un not in control
○ Kim Jong Un's death would require massive military response
South Korea’s top security brass on Thursday “confirmed” that there has been no unusual activity in North Korea that would indicate that dictator Kim Jong Un was on death’s door. The confirmation followed speculation that leader Kim may be seriously ill, according to Cheong Wa Dae — also known as the Blue House — the complex that houses the South’s federal government in Seoul, the country’s Yonhap news agency reported. The military and security leaders investigated what’s going on in the secretive Communist country during their weekly session of the National Security Council standing committee. They “confirmed no unusual situations currently inside North Korea,” Cheong Wa Dae said in a statement. Kim, 36, has been out of public sight since April 12, and was even a no-show at the key annual ceremony to commemorate his late grandfather, North Korea founder Kim Il-sung, on April 15. His unusual absence led to some US news reports that he had undergone heart surgery. But Cheong Wa Dae officials said it appeared to be business as usual in the Hermit Kingdom while Kim was staying in a “local region,” and not Pyongyang, the capital. A day earlier, the vice chair of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff said he had no reason to believe that Kim — an overweight heavy smoker who reportedly suffers from a range of health problems — was not still “in full control” of the country. Gen. John Hyten said military intelligence didn’t confirm or deny reports that Kim was in poor health following a recent surgical procedure. “In the intel, I don’t have anything to confirm or deny anything along those lines, so I assume that Kim Jong Un is still in full control of the Korean nuclear force and the Korean military forces,” Hyten told reporters at the Pentagon. “I have no reason not to assume that,” he said, comments that came the same day the North said Kim had sent a letter to Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad to thank him for a recent note wishing him well. Authorities have also warned that Kim’s death could trigger a huge humanitarian crisis, including mass starvation and an exodus of refugees to neighboring China. The US reportedly has a contingency plan in place that would leave much of the work to China, an ally of the dictatorship.

Reddit's coverage of the Colorado massacre: The future of citizen journalism?

'Why Is Reddit So Anti-Women?': An Epic Reddit Thread Counts the Ways


On the night of the massacre that killed 12 people in Aurora, Colo., 18-year-old Morgan Jones of Denver was up late playing a video game when he spied a Facebook update from his local news station reporting a possible shooting at a movie theater. Jones began a thread on the popular social-media news site Reddit that over the course of the night morphed into what many are describing as the most comprehensive timeline to emerge from the event, replete with minute-by-minute tweets from witnesses, reports from traditional media sources, and police scanner updates. Jones and his fellow Redditors also had some major scoops, unearthing the picture of alleged shooter James Holmes from the online dating site AdultFriendFinder.com, the first to show him with his distinctive red hair. Many commentators say Reddit's coverage exemplifies a new breed of journalism, though some, like CNN's Howard Kurtz, criticized the timeline as error-ridden. Is Reddit's style of citizen journalism the wave of the future?

Yes. Social media is changing journalism: Jones' coverage was the most valuable information available during the early hours after the massacre, so much so that "reporters began looking to the Reddit posts... to report what Jones had already aggregated," says Linda Sharps at The Stir. Yes, there were mistakes, but Jones corrected them as he went along in a way that was transparent for readers. (CNN contributors should hardly cast stones when it comes to mistakes, given that CNN "infamously miffed the Supreme Court ruling" on ObamaCare, reporting that it had been struck down.) "Media outlets should wake up and take note — because what Morgan Jones did last week just may be the future of journalism."
"Colorado shootings details reported best in early hours by teenager on Reddit"

Traditional media outlets should embrace the trend: Citizen journalism "may not replace the traditional journalism we're used to," but it could "bring additional benefits that mainstream journalism doesn't provide," says Mathew Ingram at GigaOm. Reddit's "crowdsourced newsroom" taps into an on-the-ground network that no single reporter, or even a team of reporters, could access. Traditional media outlets should "find as many ways of letting people contribute to journalism as possible," and take advantage of the fact that "journalism is everywhere" now.
"Learning from this week's crash course in citizen journalism"

Citizen journalism is sensationalist journalism on steroids: "Citizen journalism is doing more or less the exact same thing that traditional journalism has always done, except not as reliably or sustainably," says Michael Barthel at Salon. Citizen journalism is "really good at breaking news about shootings and war, the same 'if it bleeds, it leads' coverage that the media is frequently criticized for overemphasizing." For instance, "it's unclear what practical value" Holmes' picture has, but it's exactly the type of item scoop-obsessed journalists compete over. "The rush-to-coverage aspect of news is arguably more of an ill than a good… and it's hard to tell why doing the same thing only faster is a laudable improvement."

Consider each act of welfare to be a debt. This debt has been bought both from the current and the future generation for your prosperity. The governemnt tries to take it back by the way of taxes. Your ability to prosper is a reflection of what the state has been able to accomplish.

Anti-adultery Law Assumed Women Contracted Away Their Sexual Agency.
https://www.news18.com/news/india/anti-adultery-law-assumed-women-contracted-away-their-sexual-agency-says-justice-chandrachud-1891553.html
Justice Chandrachud said Section 497 (punishment for adultery) of IPC is "a gender stereotype" that the infidelity of a man is normal but that of a woman is impermissible.

The penal provision on adultery curtails the sexual autonomy of a woman on the assumption that once she gets married, she "contracts away" her "sexual agency", Justice D Y Chandrachud Thursday said while striking down the anti-adultery law. 

☺
Section 376C criminalises sexual intercourse by a person in authority. It states that anybody in a position of authority or fiduciary relationship, who “abuses such position or fiduciary relationship to induce or seduce any woman either in his custody or under his charge or present in the premises to have sexual intercourse with him, such sexual intercourse not amounting to the offence of rape, shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than five years, but which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine”.
The abuse of position by a person in authority to “induces or seduces” a woman to have sexual intercourse has been criminalised. This sexual intercourse doesn't amounting to the offence of rape as it is consensual, but it will be punishable with imprisonment of five to 10 years, and a fine. The provision was included through an amendment in 2013, on the basis of recommendations made by the Justice J.S. Verma committee after the 2012 Delhi gang rape case. Former BJP MP and union minister Swami Chinmayanand was accused of raping a law student inside his ashram in UP’s Shahjahanpur. After trial, he was charged with one count of 376C, along with Sections 506 (criminal intimidation), 342 (wrongful confinement), 354D (stalking).

Masturbation and testosterone: Is there a link?
https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325418
Masturbation may have short-term effects on testosterone levels. The researchers compared the salivary testosterone levels between men who participated in sexual activity and men who only observed. Testosterone levels increased in all the men who visited the sex club. Testosterone Increase was significantly higher in those who participated in sexual activity.
• 1992 study
• https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0031938492904539
• In both men and women, testosterone levels were highest after intercourse.
• The results suggest that sexual activity influences testosterone rather than testosterone influencing sexual activity.
• In a 2007 study on rats, researchers found that the number of estrogen receptors was higher 24 hours after ejaculation or mating to sexual satiety. Estrogen receptors help the body use estrogen.
• A different study on rats from 2007 found that the number of androgen receptors, which help the body use testosterone, was lower 24 hours after ejaculation or sexual satiety.
• There is some research on the effect of abstinence on testosterone levels which suggest that abstinence from masturbation or abstinence from sexual activity can raise testosterone levels. A study from 2003 measured testosterone levels in men after various lengths of abstinence from ejaculation. There was minimal movement in testosterone levels between 2 and 5 days of abstinence. However, testosterone levels peaked after 7 days of abstinence.
• https://link.springer.com/article/10.1631%2Fjzus.2003.0236
• Testosterone has an influence on sex drive in both men and women. The study sought to find a link between saliva testosterone levels and sexual desire, whether alone or with a partner. Testosterone has more significant effect on men’s sex drive due to their naturally higher levels of testosterone. For women, testosterone had a definite connection to masturbatory desire but a negative link to sexual desire with a partner. Men showed a higher sexual desire than women.

TCS CEO says the business model is 20 years old and it's time to go employee-lite (Prabhjote Gill A)
pr 21, 2020, 12:32 IST
TCS is gearing up to make its new 25/25 secure borderless workplace (SBWS) model the ‘new normal' even after the Coronavirus pandemic comes to end and the lockdown is lifted. According to the company, this model will enable a 25% increase in throughput and estimates that it won't need more than 25% of its workforce in the actual offices to be 100% productive. The lockdown forced companies to make their employees work from home, but it doesn't seem to have dampened the spirits of India's largest IT company, Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS). Its CEO Rajesh Gopitnathan believes that the crisis has actually been good as it forced them to shift to the next phase of their operating model. It includes employees only having to be in the office 25% of the time. And, the offices will only need 25% of its total strength on any given day. "It's about time. Our current operating model is currently a 20-year-old legacy. In some ways, this crisis actually leapfrogs us into a new model,” he said during the fourth-quarter earnings call. The new secure borderless workspaces (SBWS) model will increase the company's velocity or throughput by 25%, according to TCS' chief operating officer N Ganapathy Subramaniam. What this essentially means is that TCS is going to make work from home the new normal once the Coronavirus pandemic blows over. Although, that's hardly surprising since fewer employees in the office could result in more savings as many studies show. "Our proven business continuity processes got enhanced and securely, from 100% work from approved facilities to 90% operating remotely and securely connecting to our clients and TCS systems and networks.," said the company in a statement.

How did Coronavirus inspire TCS' new workspace model?
The Coronavirus pandemic may have forced the IT company to suddenly push their employees to work from home, but according to Gopinathan, the shift has been in the works for a while. "For the last few years, we have actually been pushing the concept to its next evolutionary path by what we call the open agile workspace concept,” he said. With the ongoing health crisis, TCS was forced to switch all the elements of its operating model. To not just SBWS, but also to the extended environment. "This is not just about moving the person out from the office and allowing a laptop or a desktop located in the house to connect,” Gopinathan explained. He claims that other than the fact that the person has actually shifted out, no other perceptible reduction in quality or certainty has been noticed by the company's clients. It will be the ‘new normal' even after the pandemic. Even after the Coronavirus pandemic comes to a close and the lockdown is over — TCS plans to continue with their SBWS model. "We're not going to go back to where we were. The reason we have been able to get on top of it is that we had invested in building those processes and systems,” said Gopinathan. Over the past few weeks, TCS claims that they released they don't need to have more than 25% of their workforce in the office in order to be 100% productive. "We don't believe that every employee needs to be present all the time at our offices. I think it's sufficient that they spend 25% of their time in the office,” said Subramaniam. "We also believe that 25% of the project team may not be located in one single location,” he added.
ICICI Direct forecasts that this will put TCS in a position to provide a unique differentiation of its services, setting it apart from the rest of the industry. Currently, more than 90% of the company's employees are working from home. The model is going to put us a much better position to capture demand as customers are moving towards resilience and agility in the post-Covid scenario. "TCS does not see milestones slipping at this point of time,” said Nirmal Bang's report on the TCS' fourth-quarter earnings. According to Gopinathan, this does not mean that people will lose their jobs. Being loyal to its talent is once of the ‘core principles' of the company and they plan to stick to it in the coming days. In addition to honouring the offers made to freshers, TCS will also be promoting its employees. "We also want to reaffirm that our loyalty to our employee base is total. We don't see any form of retrenchment or any such activity happening due to the cause of the Coronavirus, which will only accelerate in the coming few weeks and months,” he said. However, there will be no salary increments this year. Note: The article was edited to reflect that 25% throughput is expected to increase once the new 25/25 model is in place, not a 25% increase in efficiency.

The article was written on 9th April & it's 22nd today. The first comment below the article by Laura Rheinschmidt Reibenstein reads: "Yes, China has been so forth coming in all of this. There are several US hospitals that have had outstanding success with combo protocols. Doesn't seem like others are willing to try them. Wonder why." Now, I'm not a doctor & many of us don't know yet if chloroquine is actually a cure at all. Doctors across the globe may have different opinions & parties who have a responsibility to bring us the facts should bring it to us as genuinely as possible. We should respect such opinions too. They obviously have to be backed by information that's relevant to us, that majority of us can decipher. But sponsoring an article, that contains stale news almost 2 weeks old, highlighting "CHINA & ITS OPINIONS", well, that's next level stupid. This gives fodder to the idea of "paid / bought-out media" & destroys the credibility, of whatever is left of it. Someone clearly needs to re-think their Advertising strategy here, or may be the title of the article. There was another lame article (it was genuinely paid for):

Discriminatory guidelines have leaked in the past, revealing that TikTok intentionally prevented posts from LGBTQ users and users with disabilities from surfacing. Guidelines for moderators of the famous app have recently surfaced on the Internet, and they include to erase the content from people with “ugly facial looks” or people who shot videos in “slums” or “dilapidated housing” in an attempt to “prevent bullying”. The guidelines also ban people with beer guts, old decorations or cracked walls, in order to promote more attractive videos. The app has experienced a bigger surge due to people in quarantine due to recent global events.

• While one camp has come down heavily on the NGO's high handedness in providing food according to its own norm - non-onion and non-garlic food - ignoring food and taste preferences of children, the other camp hails it for providing clean and hygienic food to around 1.8 million children across 15,000 schools in 12 states. 
• "Each unlimited meal costs us Rs 11-11.5, the government (Union and state governments) provides 60 per cent of it and the rest is raised by us through donations," says TV Mohandas Pai, who is on the board of the trustee of Akshaya Patra.
• The government also provides Rs 5.5 as making charges for each meal and allocates grain from Food Corporation of India (FCI).
Mohandas Pai says that the food supplied adheres to the nutritional standards laid down by Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD). "We don't put onion and garlic in our food as we follow Ayurveda system (Indian system) to make sure that we give healthy food to kids," he says.
• However, if some states want to give egg, they have no objection, he adds. Their only condition is that states will have to provide egg directly to students. Some states like Odisha and Telangana provide egg in their mid-day meals. There is different menu for each state.
• Incidentally, the recent controversy emanated from Karnataka as officials noted that many students were opting out of mid-day meal as they do not like the no-onion, no-garlic food served in school.

Why The Vertical Takeoff Airliner Failed: The Rotodyne Story
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairey_Rotodyne
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkJOm1V77Xg
The Fairey Rotodyne was a 1950s British compound gyroplane designed and built by Fairey Aviation and intended for commercial and military uses.[2] A development of the earlier Gyrodyne, which had established a world helicopter speed record, the Rotodyne featured a tip-jet-powered rotor that burned a mixture of fuel and compressed air bled from two wing-mounted Napier Eland turboprops. The rotor was driven for vertical takeoffs, landings and hovering, as well as low-speed translational flight and autorotated during cruise flight with all engine power applied to two propellers. 

The Jet Gyrodyne was a modification of the second prototype FB-1 Gyrodyne aircraft registered G-AJJP. The Jet Gyrodyne was built specifically to develop the pressure-jet rotor drive system and operational procedures used on the later Rotodyne.

Auto Gyros 
Inventor: Juan de la Cierva 

Auto Gyros are the concept from the 1920s. Used primarily for Navy & military reconnaisance operations. Even, to deliver mail.
The autogyro was invented by Spanish engineer Juan de la Cierva in an attempt to create an aircraft that could fly safely at low speeds. He first flew one on 9 January 1923, at Cuatro Vientos Airfield in Madrid.[1] Cierva's autogyro is considered the predecessor of the modern helicopter.[2][3] The aircraft resembled the fixed-wing aircraft of the day, with a front-mounted engine and propeller.

Charles Augustus Magnussen is a media mogul who owns several newspapers. He has powerful connections across the Western World and also ties to those in the British government, one of them being Mycroft Holmes. Magnussen is also a blackmailer and uses the information against his "assets" (which he views his victims as).Cold, calculating, and an egomaniac, Magnussen displayed a disregard for social niceties. A sociopath, Magnussen had a misanthropic view of other people, to the point of possessing a superiority complex.[1] He also displayed traits of extreme sadism and megalomania. Examples of his superiority complex were categorised by his utter disregard for human happiness, inflated sense of entitlement, narcissistic view on how other people think and behave, and even going so far as to torment his victims to get what he wanted. He relished demonstrating his power for its own sake. Sherlock Holmes considered him to be far worse than any killer, serial killer, or terrorist that he had encountered and the one man who could turn his stomach. Magnussen was perverse, showing little respect for the privacy, boundaries, and personal space of others, sexually harassing Lady Smallwood and later Sherlock in his hospital bed. He was often cruel and manipulative, not caring about the feelings of others except when they served his purposes. Magnussen also had an eidetic memory. He utilised this trait to remember incriminating data on individuals of importance, which he would then use to deduce the so-called "pressure points" of individuals to exploit their weaknesses and blackmail them into subservience. Through this, Magnussen demonstrated extraordinary levels of intellectual genius that not only surpassed that of Sherlock Holmes but were even on the same level of intellect as the latter's brother, Mycroft, and he was quite well-versed in psychological warfare, staying a step ahead of Sherlock all the time and ultimately managing to outfox the genius detective at his own game. This intellect marks him as the second most intelligent human on Earth, inferior only to the later revealed Eurus Holmes, who was even smarter than Mycroft. He is believed by some fans, because of his nature and personality, to be in many ways even worse and more dangerous than Moriarty(it is safe to assume that only the more intelligent Eurus surpassed Magnussen in danger level) Despite his arrogant and overconfident attitude, Magnussen was not above begging for his life when threatened by Mary Watson, fearing death.

Never have I ever imagined that 2020 would be a year full of catastrophy and some African people dancing with a coffin will be the most relatable meme.
Yes. It's the first meme in a while that gets better and more creative with each video.
Honestly, i’ve seen so many memes, i’ve made so many memes, but this, this one right here, we may UNIRONICALLY actually be at peak comedy right now, this is the best stuff i’ve ever seen in my entire life, it’s also the only thing making me laugh through these Corona times.
I think the fact that the meme has a song strongly associated with it makes it super adaptable.
Also the dubstep drop will never get old.
Sorry but Astronomia is not dubstep
Also seems like the Chinese are making the best versions of this meme right now. (I suppose this video was probably made in Hongkong, since using keys on elevator buttons is common there.)
The pandemic has done one good thing. It's made everyone more creative. Not saying it was worth it by any means, just that at least something good came from it.

Honestly. If the virus doesn’t get ya, these tornado storms will.

It's a wristwatch that could only have belonged to someone like Pablo Escobar: a solid gold Rolex encrusted with hundreds of fine diamonds. With a sale value estimated at $70,000 (£43,000), it went to the highest bidder at Colombia's first warehouse auction of narco-goods for the equivalent of just $8,500 (£5,300).
A knock-off Rolex that was owned by a Farc rebel commander known as Raúl Reyes, meanwhile, went for three times its street price.

An Answer to a Monetary Riddle
By David Henderson

Last quarter, I received the following “riddle” from a student in my class:

    It’s a slow day in some little town……..
    The sun is hot….the streets are deserted.
    Times are tough, everybody is in debt, and everybody lives on credit.

    On this particular day a rich tourist from back west is driving thru town.
    He stops at the motel and lays a $100 bill on the desk saying he wants to inspect the rooms upstairs in order to pick one to spend the night.
    As soon as the man walks upstairs, the owner grabs the bill and runs next door to pay his debt to the butcher.
    The butcher takes the $100 and runs down the street to retire his debt to the pig farmer.
    The pig farmer takes the $100 and heads off to pay his bill at the feed store.

    The guy at the Farmer’s Co-op takes the $100 and runs to pay his debt to the local prostitute, who has also been facing hard times and has had to offer her services on credit.
    She, in a flash rushes to the motel and pays off her room bill with the motel owner.
    The motel proprietor now places the $100 back on the counter so the rich traveler will not suspect anything.

    At that moment the traveler comes down the stairs, picks up the $100 bill, states that the rooms are not satisfactory, pockets the money & leaves.

    NOW,… no one produced anything…and no one earned anything…however the whole town is out of debt and is looking to the future with much optimism.

Here’s monetary economist Jeffrey Rogers Hummel’s answer:

There are several ways to think about this intriguing example. But they all must recognize that these transactions have made no change in any of the parties’ NET wealth. True, at the beginning each resident has a $100 liability. But each also has an offsetting financial asset of $100. At the end, they all have neither. So the $100 bill acts as a clearing mechanism.

If you want to think of the town as a distinct economy, then the rich tourist has temporarily increased the town’s money stock by $100. In effect, he has made a short-term loan of a new $100 bill, increasing liquidity. The $100 provides the residents with a medium of exchange that allows them to clear their offsetting debts.

Or if you broaden the economy to include the rich tourist, his short-term loan has provided liquidity through increasing the transactions velocity of money. If the rich tourist hadn’t provided the loan, any of the residents could have accomplished the same result by borrowing $100 cash from someone else. No new final goods and services were produced (they had been produced already). But borrowing from the tourist may have cost less interest (zero percent) than otherwise. (I’m ignoring the possible complication that the hotel owner only gets a zero-percent loan by embezzling: using the tourist’s deposit without permission.)

Either way, the $100 cash would have been unnecessary if the residents had a central clearinghouse. The fact that the hotel owner seems to know that the $100 bill will come back quickly suggests they already had everything necessary for an informal clearing, and didn’t need the bill in the first place. The hotel owner could have gone to each party in succession, offering to take on their debt if they cancelled his.

Nonetheless, the example illustrates Mises’s point that increases in the efficiency of the clearing system reduce the demand for (increase the velocity of) money. A clearing system is an alternative way of providing medium of exchange services. In fact, in my classes I use a similar example with fewer parties to illustrate the nature and benefits of a clearing system. At the limit, a perfectly efficient clearing system would be an all-encompassing network of computerized barter making money completely unnecessary. So your student’s intuition is partly right. What the tourist’s short-term loan has produced is monetary services.

The Insidious 'Toxic Masculinity' Myth is Damaging Humanity
Thoughty2:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwSvQwuPcR4

Biology compells men and women to adhere to their natural gender roles. And that forcibly preventing them from embracing this is actually a form of child abuse.
- Just a thought.

Children who grow up without a father figure are twice as likely to drop out of school, twice as likely to become obese and four times as likely to be impoverished. They are also more likely to commit crime, go to prison, abuse alcohol or drugs. And Father-less girls are 7 times more likely to become pregnant as a teen.

The right to choose - A man shouldn't be stripped off of his rights to choose how they want to develop through their life. If a men want to go against their natural masculinity, or even speak to abolish it, then we should all protect their right to do so. But, it's so very important that men have the right to choose. Just like freedom of speech, it's essential that as a society, we work to protect a man or a woman's right to live how they want to live, be who they want to be, walk how they want to, talk how they want to and wear whatever they desire.

When it comes to a man's right to fully embrace and assert his masculinity in a positive way, it's often labeled as sexist male privilege by media and tribal activists on the internet and on campus. In doing so, a man's right to choose and embrace his masculinity is being eroded more and more so every year.

A youtube comment: ChryHavoK: The world works like a swinging pendulum. Oppression merely swings through equality into oppression of what was previously the oppressors, but hopefully just like a pendulum it will eventually lose momentum and sit on the fine line that is equality. 


If gillette cared about gender and equity, then they should probably start with their razor prices. They had no problem lowering the prices before to prevent Dollar Shave club destroying them.

A youtube comment on Prenuptial Agreements:

Kevin Lee:
Alright, her reaction is pretty sketchy. 
Getting a prenup is the same thing as getting a will. 
Do people who sign a will do it because they want to die? No.
Do people get fire insurance because they want their house to burn down? No.
Just because you sign a prenup doesn't mean you intend to want/plan a divorce. It's insurance that if one happens then both parties on the safe side. And it guarantees that money is not apart of the issue because its off the table.

Georgism, also called geoism[2] and the single tax movement (archaic), is an economic ideology holding that while people should own the value they produce themselves, economic value derived from land (including all natural resources and natural opportunities) should belong equally to all members of society.[3][4][5] Developed from the writings of American economist and social reformer Henry George, the Georgist paradigm seeks solutions to social and ecological problems, based on principles of land rights and public finance which attempt to integrate economic efficiency with social justice.[6][7]

A Shaggy defense is a legal strategy in which the defendant denies that they were the one witnessed or recorded committing an alleged act.
The strategy's name is derived from reggae musician Shaggy's 2000 single "It Wasn't Me", which is based around the concept.
It was coined by Slate writer Josh Levin in 2008 to describe the defense used by singer R. Kelly while he was on trial for child pornography charges.

No it’s not your money: why taxation isn’t theft
https://www.taxjustice.net/2014/10/08/money-taxation-isnt-theft/


No it’s not your money

Why taxation isn’t theft

Many political arguments start from the assumption that taxation is the government taking ‘our money’ off us. When austerity hit the arts in 2011, Dr Steve Davies of the pseudo-think-tank the Institute of Economic Affairs argued on Channel Four news [TJN: a mainstream UK television current affairs programme] that the 20% cuts to the arts didn’t go far enough: art funding should be entirely abolished on the grounds that it’s unfair to take people’s money off them by force to pay for something they may not want. Again and again the economic right stoke resentment at the state allegedly taking what’s ours by force, and use this resentment to build support for a programme of small government.

But even those who believe in relatively big government tend to share this understanding of taxation as the appropriation by government of ‘our money’. Most on the economic left start from the assumption that it is all things being equal a bad thing that the state takes our money from us, but hold that this prima facie bad is justified by the public goods which taxation makes possible. Well-meaning [UK] public intellectual Alain de Botton encourages us to think of taxation as charity: we give up what’s ours for the greater good of our society.

So both sides tend to agree that one has some kind of right or entitlement to one’s pre-tax income. The economic right believe that the right to pre-tax income is inalienable, or at least that it is trumped only by the absolute necessity of providing the basic requirements of society, such as roads and rule of law. In contrast, the economic left tend to value the good of making society more equal, or of providing a basic standard of living for all, above the good of letting people keep their own money.

This feeling that your pre-tax income is ‘your money’ is difficult to shake. It’s hard not to see the pre-tax figure on your payslip as representing what’s really owing to you for the work you’ve done, and hence to feel that the state is taking away from you something that is yours by right. However, a little careful reflection shows this almost universal assumption to be utterly confused. There is no sense in which you have a right to your pre-tax income.

To see this, we have to ask what kind of right it might be supposed one has to one’s pre-tax income. Presumably, it is either a legal right or a moral right. Once we separate out these alternatives, we can see that the former option is incoherent, whilst the latter is utterly implausible.

You clearly don’t have a legal right to your pre-tax income, as you are legally obliged to pay tax on it. This is a simple analytic truth that follows from the definition of taxation. People who don’t take pay their taxes go (or at least legally ought to go) to gaol.

So if there is a general right to one’s pre-tax income, then it must be a moral right. But it is implausible to suppose that each person has a moral right to his or her pre-tax income, for that would imply that the distribution of pre-tax incomes the market happens to throw up is perfectly just, and this is clearly not the case. There is no justice in the fact that the pre-tax income of a City banker is many hundreds of times the pre-tax income of scientist working on a cure for cancer. This is just an accident of the way our market economy is structured. To hold that each person has a moral right to their pre-tax income would be to hold that the market economy just happens to deliver to each person exactly what they deserve, and this is clearly not the case.

Perhaps there are specific cases in which a person happens to deserve their pre-tax income; these would be rare and happy co-incidences in which the market happens to deliver exactly what is deserved. But the mere fact that your pre-tax income is £X does not entail that in any morally significant sense you are entitled to £X. The money the market happens to throw at you is not necessarily the money you deserve. No doubt you have worked hard for that money; no doubt you have made a contribution to the public good; you have special talents that others lack, etc. But others also work hard/are talented/make a contribution, and the market has not taken these morally significant factors into consideration in working out what to give to whom. For better or worse it’s almost certainly not fair that you have what you have relative to what others have got.

It’s the responsibility of law makers, then, not to respect pre-tax incomes, but to disrespect pre-tax incomes. Insofar as the market fails to yield a just distribution of incomes, the state should work to correct that distribution. Of course, to some degree the scope for such correction will be limited by economic realities. The pragmatic argument between right and left as to the relationship between tax levels and incentives to work or invest is a perfectly sensible one. But it is crucial to distinguish the pragmatic argument of the economic right, ‘We must lower taxes in order to encourage investment’, from the moral argument of the economic right ‘We must lower taxes in order to give people more of their money’. The former argument is based on an empirical claim which stands or falls with the data. The latter argument is based on the wholly confused notion that there is something morally significant about the distribution of incomes the market happens to have thrown up.

Your pre-tax income isn’t the money you deserve; it is the money the amoral market has gifted you. A government may have cause to respect the whims of the market as a matter of practical necessity. But the state has no moral reason to respect the whims of the market. The only legitimate bar to redistribution is economic reality. Any politician who thinks it a good thing, in and of itself, to give people more of ‘their money’ is confused.

(A similar argument is made at length in ‘The Myth of Ownership’ by Murphy and Nagel, published by Oxford University Press).

How TikTok Holds Our Attention
Jia Tolentino
40-50 minutes

Marcella is eighteen and lives in a Texas suburb so quiet that it sometimes seems like a ghost town. She downloaded TikTok last fall, after seeing TikTok videos that had been posted on YouTube and Instagram. They were strange and hilarious and reminded her of Vine, the discontinued platform that teen-agers once used for uploading anarchic six-second videos that played on a loop. She opened TikTok, and it began showing her an endless scroll of videos, most of them fifteen seconds or less. She watched the ones she liked a few times before moving on, and double-tapped her favorites, to “like” them. TikTok was learning what she wanted. It showed her more absurd comic sketches and supercuts of people painting murals, and fewer videos in which girls made fun of other girls for their looks.

When you watch a video on TikTok, you can tap a button on the screen to respond with your own video, scored to the same soundtrack. Another tap calls up a suite of editing tools, including a timer that makes it easy to film yourself. Videos become memes that you can imitate, or riff on, rapidly multiplying much the way the Ice Bucket Challenge proliferated on Facebook five years ago.

Marcella was lying on her bed looking at TikTok on a Thursday evening when she began seeing video after video set to a clip of the song “Pretty Boy Swag,” by Soulja Boy. In each one, a person would look into the camera as if it were a mirror, and then, just as the song’s beat dropped, the camera would cut to a shot of the person’s doppelgänger. It worked like a punch line. A guy with packing tape over his nose became Voldemort. A girl smeared gold paint on her face, put on a yellow hoodie, and turned into an Oscar statue. Marcella propped her phone on her desk and set the TikTok timer. Her video took around twenty minutes to make, and is thirteen seconds long. She enters the frame in a white button-down, her hair dark and wavy. She adjusts her collar, checks her reflection, looks upward, and—the beat drops—she’s Anne Frank.

Marcella’s friends knew about TikTok, but almost none of them were on it. She didn’t think that anyone would see what she’d made. Pretty quickly, though, her video began getting hundreds of likes, thousands, tens of thousands. People started sharing it on Instagram. On YouTube, the Swedish vlogger PewDiePie, who has more than a hundred million subscribers, posted a video mocking the media for suggesting that TikTok had a “Nazi problem”—Vice had found various accounts promoting white-supremacist slogans—then showed Marcella’s video, laughed, and said, “Never mind, actually, this does not help the case I was trying to make.” (PewDiePie has been criticized for employing anti-Semitic imagery in his videos, though his fans insist that his work is satire.) Marcella started to get direct messages on TikTok and Instagram, some of which called her anti-Semitic. One accused her of promoting Nazism. She deleted the video.

In February, a friend texted me a YouTube rip of Marcella’s TikTok. I was alone with my phone at my desk on a week night, and when I watched the video I screamed. It was terrifyingly funny, like a well-timed electric shock. It also made me feel very old. I’d seen other TikToks, mostly on Twitter, and my primary impression was that young people were churning through images and sounds at warp speed, repurposing reality into ironic, bite-size content. Kids were clearly better than adults at whatever it was TikTok was for—“I haven’t seen one piece of content on there made by an adult that’s normal and good,” Jack Wagner, a “popular Instagram memer,” told The Atlantic last fall—though they weren’t the only ones using the platform. Arnold Schwarzenegger was on TikTok, riding a minibike and chasing a miniature pony. Drag queens were on TikTok, opera singers were on TikTok, the Washington Post was on TikTok, dogs I follow on Instagram were on TikTok. Most important, the self-made celebrities of Generation Z were on TikTok, a cohort of people in their teens and early twenties who have spent a decade filming themselves through a front-facing camera and meticulously honing their understanding of what their peers will respond to and what they will ignore.

I sent an e-mail to Marcella. (That’s her middle name.) She’s from a military family, and likes to stay up late listening to music and writing. Marcella is Jewish, and she and her brothers were homeschooled. Not long before she made her video, her family had stopped at a base to renew their military I.D.s. One of her brothers glanced at her new I.D. and joked, accurately, that she looked like Anne Frank.

In correspondence, Marcella was as earnest and thoughtful as her video had seemed flip. She understood that it could seem offensive out of context—a context that was invisible to nearly everyone who saw it—and she was sanguine about the angry messages that she’d received. TikTok, like the rest of the world, was a mixed bag, she thought, with bad ideas, and cruelty, and embarrassment, but also with so much creative potential. Its ironic sensibility was perfectly suited for people her age, and so was its industrial-strength ability to turn non-famous people into famous ones—even if only temporarily, even if only in a minor way. Marcella had accepted her brush with Internet fame as an odd thrill, and not an entirely foreign one: her generation had grown up on YouTube, she noted, watching ordinary kids become millionaires by turning on laptop cameras in their bedrooms and talking about stuff they like. The videos that I’d been seeing, chaotic and sincere and nihilistic and very short, were the natural expressions of kids who’d had smartphones since they were in middle school, or elementary school. TikTok, Marcella explained, was a simple reaction to, and an absurdist escape from, “the mass amounts of media we are exposed to every living day.”

TikTok has been downloaded more than a billion times since its launch, in 2017, and reportedly has more monthly users than Twitter or Snapchat. Like those apps, it’s free, and peppered with advertising. I downloaded TikTok in May, adding its neon-shaded music-note logo to the array of app icons on my phone. TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, is based in China, which, in recent years, has invested heavily and made major advances in artificial intelligence. After a three-billion-dollar investment from the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, last fall, ByteDance was valued at more than seventy-five billion dollars, the highest valuation for any startup in the world.

I opened the app, and saw a three-foot-tall woman making her microwave door squeak to the melody of “Yeah!,” by Usher, and then a dental hygienist and her patient dancing to “Baby Shark.” A teen-age girl blew up a bunch of balloons that spelled “PUSSY” to the tune of a jazz song from the beloved soundtrack of the anime series “Cowboy Bebop.” Young white people lip-synched to audio of nonwhite people in ways that ranged from innocently racist to overtly racist. A kid sprayed shaving cream into a Croc and stepped into it so that shaving cream squirted out of the holes in the Croc. In five minutes, the app had sandblasted my cognitive matter with twenty TikToks that had the legibility and logic of a narcoleptic dream.

TikTok is available in a hundred and fifty markets. Its videos are typically built around music, so language tends not to pose a significant barrier, and few of the videos have anything to do with the news, so they don’t easily become dated. The company is reportedly focussing its growth efforts on the U.S., Japan, and India, which is its biggest market—smartphone use in the country has swelled, and TikTok now has two hundred million users there. ByteDance often hacks its way into a market, aggressively courting influencers on other social-media networks and spending huge amounts on advertising, much of which runs on competing platforms. Connie Chan, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, told me that investors normally look for “organic growth” in social apps; ByteDance has been innovative, she said, in its ability and willingness to spend its way to big numbers. One former TikTok employee I spoke to was troubled by the company’s methods: “On Instagram, they’d run ads with clickbaity images—an open, gashed wound, or an overtly sexy image of a young teen girl—and it wouldn’t matter if Instagram users flagged the images as long as the ad got a lot of engagement first.”

In April, the Indian government briefly banned new downloads of the app, citing concerns that it was exposing minors to pornography and sexual predation. (At least three people in India have died from injuries sustained while creating TikToks: posing with a pistol, hanging out on train tracks, trying to fit three people on a moving bike.) In court, ByteDance insisted that it was losing five hundred thousand dollars a day from the ban. The company announced plans to hire more local content moderators and to invest a billion dollars in India during the next three years. The ban was lifted, and the company launched a campaign: every day, three randomly selected users who promoted TikTok on other platforms with the hashtag #ReturnOfTikTok would receive the equivalent of fourteen hundred dollars.

TikTok is a social network that has nothing to do with one’s social network. It doesn’t ask you to tell it who you know—in the future according to ByteDance, “large-scale AI models” will determine our “personalized information flows,” as the Web site for the company’s research lab declares. The app provides a “Discover” page, with an index of trending hashtags, and a “For You” feed, which is personalized—if that’s the right word—by a machine-learning system that analyzes each video and tracks user behavior so that it can serve up a continually refined, never-ending stream of TikToks optimized to hold your attention. In the teleology of TikTok, humans were put on Earth to make good content, and “good content” is anything that is shared, replicated, and built upon. In essence, the platform is an enormous meme factory, compressing the world into pellets of virality and dispensing those pellets until you get full or fall asleep.

ByteDance has more than a dozen products, a number of which depend on A.I. recommendation engines. These platforms collect data that the company aggregates and uses to refine its algorithms, which the company then uses to refine its platforms; rinse, repeat. This feedback loop, called the “virtuous cycle of A.I.,” is what each TikTok user experiences in miniature. The company would not comment on the details of its recommendation algorithm, but ByteDance has touted its research into computer vision, a process that involves extracting and classifying visual information; on the Web site of its research lab, the company lists “short video recommendation system” among the applications of the computer-vision technology that it’s developing. Although TikTok’s algorithm likely relies in part, as other systems do, on user history and video-engagement patterns, the app seems remarkably attuned to a person’s unarticulated interests. Some social algorithms are like bossy waiters: they solicit your preferences and then recommend a menu. TikTok orders you dinner by watching you look at food.

After I had watched TikTok on and off for a couple of days, the racist lip-synchs disappeared from my feed. I started to see a lot of videos of fat dogs, teen-agers playing pranks on their teachers, retail workers making lemonade from the lemons of being bored and underpaid. I still sometimes saw things I didn’t like: people in horror masks popping into the frame, or fourteen-year-old girls trying to be sexy, or rich kids showing off the McMansions where they lived. But I often found myself barking with laughter, in thrall to the unhinged cadences of the app. The over-all effect called to mind both silent-movie slapstick and the sort of exaggerated, knowing stupidity one finds on the popular Netflix sketch show “I Think You Should Leave.” Some videos displayed new forms of digital artistry: a Polish teen-ager with braces and slate-blue eyes, who goes by @jeleniewska, makes videos in which she appears to be popping in and out of mirrors, phones, and picture frames. Others drew on surprising sources: an audio clip from Cecelia Condit’s art piece “Possibly in Michigan,” from 1983, went viral under the track label “oh no no no no no no no no silly” after a sixteen-year-old found the film on a list of “creepy videos” that had been posted on YouTube.

I found it both freeing and disturbing to spend time on a platform that didn’t ask me to pretend that I was on the Internet for a good reason. I was not giving TikTok my attention because I wanted to keep up with the news, or because I was trying to soothe and irritate myself by looking at photos of my friends on vacation. I was giving TikTok my attention because it was serving me what would retain my attention, and it could do that because it had been designed to perform algorithmic pyrotechnics that were capable of making a half hour pass before I remembered to look away.

We have been inadvertently preparing for this experience for years. On YouTube and Twitter and Instagram, recommendation algorithms have been making us feel individually catered to while bending our selfhood into profitable shapes. TikTok favors whatever will hold people’s eyeballs, and it provides the incentives and the tools for people to copy that content with ease. The platform then adjusts its predilections based on the closed loop of data that it has created. This pattern seems relatively trivial when the underlying material concerns shaving cream and Crocs, but it could determine much of our cultural future. The algorithm gives us whatever pleases us, and we, in turn, give the algorithm whatever pleases it. As the circle tightens, we become less and less able to separate algorithmic interests from our own.

One of TikTok’s early competitors was Musical.ly, a lip-synching app based in Shanghai that had a large music library and had become extremely popular with American children. In 2016, an executive at an ad agency focussed on social media told the Times that Musical.ly was “the youngest social network we’ve ever seen,” adding, “You’re talking about first, second, third grade.” ByteDance bought Musical.ly the following year, for an amount reportedly in the vicinity of a billion dollars, and merged the app with TikTok in August, 2018. In February, the Federal Trade Commission levied a $5.7-million fine against the company: the agency found that a large percentage of Musical.ly users, who were now TikTok users, were under the age of thirteen, and the app did not ask for their ages or seek parental consent, as is required by federal law. The F.T.C. “uncovered disturbing practices, including collecting and exposing the location” of these children, according to an agency statement. TikTok handled this in a blunt, makeshift fashion: it added an age gate that asked for your birthday but which defaulted to the current date, meaning that users who failed to enter their age were instantly kicked off the app, and their videos were deleted. TikTok did not seem terribly worried about the complaints that followed these deletions. It was now big enough not to care.

A few months after TikTok arrived in the U.S., a nineteen-year-old rapper and singer from Georgia named Montero Lamar Hill uploaded a song that he had been trying for weeks to promote as the basis of a meme. Hill, who goes by the stage name Lil Nas X, had spent much of his teens attempting to go viral on Twitter and elsewhere. There is a sweetness to his self-presentation, which seems optimized for digital interaction; he wears ten-gallon hats and fringe and glitter, a laugh-crying-cowboy emoji come to life. “The Internet is basically, like, my parents in a way,” he told the Times this spring, after people began making videos featuring a snippet of his song “Old Town Road,” in which they would drink “yee yee juice” and turn into cowboys and cowgirls. The song went to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in April, and stayed there longer than any song ever had.

Certain musical elements serve as TikTok catnip: bass-heavy transitions that can be used as punch lines; rap songs that are easy to lip-synch or include a narrative-friendly call and response. A twenty-six-year-old Australian producer named Adam Friedman, half of the duo Cookie Cutters, told me that he was now concentrating on lyrics that you could act out with your hands. “I write hooks, and I try it in the mirror—how many hand movements can I fit into fifteen seconds?” he said. “You know, goodbye, call me back, peace out, F you.”

TikTok employs an artist-relations team that contacts musicians whose songs are going viral and coaches them on how to use the platform. Some videos include links to Apple Music, which pays artists per stream, though not very much. Virality can thus pay off elsewhere, relieving the pressure for TikTok to compensate artists directly. It is, these days, a standard arrangement: you will be “paid” in exposure, giving your labor to a social platform in part because a lot of other people are doing it and in part because you might be one of the people whom the platform sends, however briefly, to the top.

If you are one of those people, TikTok can be a godsend. Sub Urban, a nineteen-year-old artist from New Jersey, got a deal with Warner Records after millions of TikTokers started doing a dance from the video game Fortnite to his song “Cradles.” In August, a twenty-one-year-old rapper from Sacramento who goes by the name Stunna Girl learned that a song of hers had gone viral on the app, and soon signed a record deal with Capitol. TikTok also offers artists the uniquely moving experience of watching total strangers freely and enthusiastically produce music videos for them. Jonathan Visger, an electronic artist known as Absofacto, told me that it had changed his entire outlook on his career to see nearly two million TikToks all set to his 2015 single “Dissolve,” a heady pop song that inspired a meme in which people appeared to be falling through a series of portals.

“I think the song worked well for the platform because the lyrics are ‘I just wanted you to watch me dissolve, slowly, in a pool full of your love,’ ” Visger told me recently. “Which is a lot like ‘I’m on the Internet, I want to be seen, and I want you to like it.’ ” I asked him if he’d been thinking about the Internet when he was writing it. “No!” he said, laughing. “I was thinking about unrequited love.”

ByteDance is developing a music-streaming service—which will likely launch first in emerging markets, such as India—and it is currently negotiating the renewal of old Musical.ly licensing agreements with the three companies that control roughly eighty per cent of music globally. ByteDance also has acquired a London-based startup called Jukedeck, which has been developing A.I. music-creation tools, including a program that can interpret video and compose music that suits it. Incorporating such technology into TikTok could give ByteDance total ownership of content created within the app. Multiple people at TikTok and ByteDance told me that they were not aware of any plans to add this sort of tool, but TikTok’s plans have a way of abruptly changing.

In some respects, what’s sonically valuable on TikTok isn’t any different from what has long succeeded on radio; no pop-songwriting practice is more established than crafting a good hook. But the app could begin to influence composition in other ways. Digital platforms and digital attention spans may make hit songs shorter, for instance. (“Old Town Road” clocks in at under two minutes.) Adam Friedman has begun producing music directly for influencers, and engineering it for maximum TikTok success. “We start with the snippet, and if it does well on TikTok we’ll produce the full song,” he told me. I suggested that some people might think there was a kind of artistic integrity missing from this process. “The influencer is playing a central role in our culture, and it’s not new,” he said. “There’ve always been socialites, people of influence, the Paris World’s Fair. Whatever mecca that people go to for culture is where they go to for culture, and in this moment it’s TikTok.”

TikTok’s U.S. operations are currently based at a co-working space in a generic four-story building on a busy thoroughfare in Culver City, in Los Angeles. I visited the office twice this summer, after an extensive e-mail correspondence with a company spokesperson. The first person TikTok offered for an on-the-record chat was a twenty-year-old TikToker named Ben De Almeida, who lives in Alberta and, on the app, goes by @benoftheweek. De Almeida first went viral on TikTok with a video that noted his resemblance to the actor Noah Centineo, best known for his roles on “The Fosters” and in teen movies on Netflix. De Almeida wore red striped pants and a yellow shirt and was accompanied by a handler; he radiated good-natured charisma. When I extended my hand, he immediately went in for a hug. “I’m excited to share what it’s like to be a TikToker,” he said.

De Almeida was in L.A. for the summer, “collabing,” he told me. He said that he’d “always wanted to be a creator,” using the term that has become a catchall identity for people who make money by producing content for social platforms. He’d grown up admiring YouTubers, “people like Shane Dawson and iJustine,” and had begun making online videos when he was twelve. He used to post videos on Snapchat, but he got on TikTok in November and now has two million followers. In conversation, De Almeida, like other TikTok teens I talked to, mixed the ecstatically strange dialect of people who love memes—a language in which every word sets off a chain of incomprehensible referents—with the sort of anodyne corporate jargon I associate with marketing professionals. “In this generation, you get steeped in the culture of online video,” he said. “You naturally pick up on what can be a trend.” He pulled out his phone and showed me one of his early TikTok hits, in which he pretended to put a can of beans in the microwave and burn his mom’s house down.

“Now show him projected sea levels on his golf course.”

Later that day, in West Hollywood, at an outpost of Joe & the Juice, I met with Jacob Pace, the ebullient twenty-one-year-old C.E.O. of a content-production company called Flighthouse. Pace wore a charcoal T-shirt and had the erratic energy of a champion sled dog on break. Flighthouse has more than nineteen million followers on TikTok, and its videos reflect an intuitive understanding of its audience: Pikachu in a baseball cap, dancing; a girl eating Flamin’ Hot Cheetos in a bowl full of milk. Pace has fifteen employees working under him to make TikToks, some of which serve as back-end marketing for record labels that have paid Flighthouse to promote particular songs. He was about to travel to New York to present to ad agencies. “What gets me out of bed in the morning is creating and impacting culture,” he said. Figuring out how to make TikToks that people liked and related to was, he said, like “helping to perfect a machine that will one day start running perfectly.”

Many of the people whose professional lives are dependent on or tied to TikTok were eager to talk to me, but that eagerness was not shared by people who actually work for the company. A former TikTok employee told me, in a direct message, “As strategic as it appears from the outside it’s a complete chaos on the inside.” After my first visit to the L.A. office, I sent a TikTok representative a list of questions asking for basic information, including the number of employees at the company, the number of moderators, the demographics of its users, and the number of hours of video uploaded to the platform daily. The representative informed me, weeks later, that there were “a couple hundred people working on TikTok in the US” and “thousands of moderators” across all of TikTok’s markets, and she said that she couldn’t answer any of the other questions.

TikTok’s primary selling point is that it feels unusually fun, like it’s the last sunny corner on the Internet. I asked multiple TikTok employees whether the company did anything to insure that this mood prevailed in the videos that the app served its users. Speaking with an executive, in August, about the app’s “Discover” page, I asked, “What if the most trending thing was something that you didn’t want to be the most trending thing? Would you put something else in its place?” The executive said that doing so would run counter to TikTok’s ethos. A few weeks later, the online trade magazine Digiday reported that TikTok had begun sending select media companies a weekly newsletter that previewed “the trending hashtags that the platform plans to promote.” A copy of the newsletter that I obtained lists such hashtags as #BeachDay and #AlwaysHustling, and it instructs, “If you’re interested in participating, make sure to upload your video no earlier than one day before the hashtag launch.” Later, a representative told me that the company might choose not to include certain hashtags on the “Discover” page, and that TikTok was interested in highlighting positive trends, like #TikTokDogs.

TikTok employees in Los Angeles declined to talk in any detail about their relationship to ByteDance headquarters, in Beijing, and everyone I spoke to emphasized that the U.S. operation was fairly independent. But one former employee, who left the company in 2018, described this as a “total fabrication.” (A ByteDance spokesperson, in response, said that the markets were becoming more independent and that much of that process had happened within the past year.) TikTok’s technology was developed in China, and it is refined in China. Another ex-employee, who had worked in the Shanghai office, said that nearly all product features are shipped out from Shanghai and Beijing, where most of ByteDance’s engineers are based. “At a tech company, where the engineers are is what matters,” the writer and former Facebook product manager Antonio Garcia-Martinez told me. “Everyone else is a puppet paid to lie to you.”

The direct predecessor of TikTok is Douyin, a short-video platform that ByteDance launched in China in 2016. Douyin is headquartered in Shanghai, and ByteDance says that it has more than five hundred million monthly active users. Zhou Rongrong, a twenty-nine-year-old Ph.D. candidate at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, in Beijing, who has studied Internet art in China, said that most young people in the country are on Douyin. In particular, she said, the app has opened up new kinds of economic potential for people outside the country’s traditional centers of power. “For example, I had no way before to see these ways that rural people can cook their dishes,” Zhou said. Douyin has given rise to influencers like Yeshi Xiaoge—the name means “brother who cooks in the wilderness”—who films himself preparing elaborate meals, and who has released his own line of beef sauce. Rural administrations have begun advertising their regions’ produce and tourist attractions on the app.

Though it remains broadly similar to TikTok, Douyin has become more advanced than its global counterpart, particularly with respect to e-commerce. With three taps on Douyin, you can buy a product featured in a video; you can book a stay at a hotel after watching a video shot there; you can take virtual tours of a city’s stores and restaurants, get coupons for those establishments, and later post geo-tagged video reviews. Fabian Bern, the head of a marketing company that works closely with Douyin influencers, told me that some power users can make “fifteen to twenty thousand U.S. dollars” on a shopping holiday like Singles’ Day.

So far, TikTok has concentrated more on expanding its user base than on offering opportunities for e-commerce. If TikTok wants to keep growing, it will need to attract more people who are no longer in their teens, and it will need to hold their attention. Many people are not terribly interested in even the choicest memes the world has to offer; in August, the Verge reported that a “significant majority” of new TikTok users give up on the app after thirty days. Bern thinks that TikTok content will soon become more mature, as has already happened with Douyin, which now contains micro-vlogs, life-style content, business advice, and videos from local police. Selected users on Douyin can upload videos as long as five minutes. Fictional mini-dramas have begun to appear.

“This meme content, people will get bored with it,” Bern said. “And companies are, like, ‘We cannot make this type of content or we’ll damage our brands.’ ”

ByteDance’s founder, Zhang Yiming, was twenty-nine when he started the company, in 2012. Zhang, who rarely gives interviews, was raised in Fujian Province, the son of a civil servant and a nurse, and attended university in the northern port city of Tianjin. He briefly worked at Microsoft in China, and bounced between startups for a while. He then pitched Chinese investors on the idea of a news-aggregation app that would use machine learning to provide people with whatever they wished to read. The app, called Jinri Toutiao, was launched within the year. Its name means “today’s top headlines.” It’s a bit like Reddit, if Reddit were guided by A.I. rather than by the upvotes and downvotes of its readers.

Like TikTok, Toutiao starts feeding you content as soon as you open it, and it adjusts the mix by tracking and analyzing your scrolling behavior, the time of day, and your location. It can deduce how its users read while commuting, and what they like to look at before bed. It reportedly has around a hundred and twenty million daily active users, most of whom are under thirty. On average, they read their tailored feeds for more than an hour each day. The app has a reputation for promoting lowbrow clickbait.

In China, daily life has become even more tech-driven than it is in the U.S. People can pay for things by letting cameras scan their faces; last year, a high school in Hangzhou installed scanners that recorded classrooms every thirty seconds and classified students’ facial expressions as neutral, happy, sad, angry, upset, or surprised. The Chinese government has been assembling what it calls the Social Credit System, a network of overlapping assessments of citizen trustworthiness, with opaque calculations that integrate information from public records and private databases. The government has also set benchmarks for progress in artificial-intelligence development at five-year intervals. Last year, Tianjin announced plans to put sixteen billion dollars toward A.I. funding; Shanghai announced a plan to raise fifteen billion.

There are two principal approaches to artificial intelligence. In symbolic A.I., humans give computers a set of elaborate rules that guide them through a task. This works well for things like chess, but everyday tasks—identifying faces, interpreting language—tend to be governed by human instinct as much as by rules. And so another approach, known as neural networks, or machine learning, has predominated in the past two decades or so. Under this model, computers learn by recognizing patterns in data and continually adjusting until the desired output—a correctly labelled face, a properly translated phrase—is consistently achieved. In this sort of system, the quantity of data is, broadly speaking, more important than the sophistication of the program interpreting it. The sheer number of users that Chinese companies have, and the types of data that come from the integration of tech with daily life, give those companies a crucial advantage.

Chinese tech companies are often partly funded by the government, and they openly defer to its requests, turning over user messages and purchase data, for instance. Tencent, which owns WeChat, has a “Follow Our Party” sign on a statue in front of its headquarters. The Wall Street Journal has reported that a ByteDance office in Beijing includes a room for a cybersecurity team of the Chinese police, which the company informs when it “finds criminal content like terrorism or pedophilia” on its apps. Last year, ByteDance was ordered to suspend Toutiao and to shut down a meme-centric social app called Neihan Duanzi—the name means something like “implied jokes”—because the content had become too vulgar, too disorderly, for the state. Zhang issued an apology, written in the language of government control. ByteDance had allowed content to appear that was “incommensurate with socialist core values, that did not properly implement public opinion guidance,” he said.

Three days later, the Times reported that the Chinese government had deployed facial-recognition technology to identify Uighurs, a Muslim minority in the country, through its nationwide network of surveillance cameras. China has imprisoned more than a million Uighurs in reëducation camps, in Xinjiang, and has subjected them to a surge in arrests, trials, and prison sentences. In August, I asked a ByteDance spokesperson about the fear that the massive trove of facial closeups accumulated on its various products could be misused. Even if people trusted ByteDance not to do anything sinister, I said, what if a third party got hold of the company’s data? The spokesperson told me that the data of American users was stored in-country—TikTok’s data is now kept in the U.S. and Singapore, the rep said—and noted, nonchalantly, that people made their faces available to other platforms, too. Of course, U.S. tech companies often don’t seem answerable enough to the government—or, rather, to the public. The American system has its own weaknesses.

Dinesh Raman, an A.I.-alignment researcher in Tokyo, who has studied ByteDance as a consultant for some of its investors, spoke with a mixture of alarm and admiration about the company’s A.I. capabilities. “The system is doing billions of calculations per second,” he said. “It’s data being transmitted at a scale I’ve never seen before.” Raman insisted that TikTok had kept its platform tightly policed in part through its algorithm, which, he said, is able to identify videos with dangerous content. (TikTok’s moderators are trained to apply different standards to every market, the company told me.) He pointed me to the “Gaga Dance” challenge, a meme on Indonesian TikTok that asked users to mirror the poses of cheerful yellow stick figures that floated across the screen. The A.I., he suggested, was training itself in pose estimation, a deep-learning capability with major surveillance implications. OpenPose, a program developed at Carnegie Mellon, has been used by a Japanese telecom company to alert shopkeepers to customers whose movements supposedly signal that they are likely to steal something.

The Chinese government is more interested in surveilling and controlling its own citizens than it is in monitoring foreign nationals; one of the reasons that ByteDance launched TikTok as a separate entity from Douyin was to establish a firewall between the Chinese state and users outside China. But state interference can cross borders. In August, Facebook and Twitter revealed that they’d found evidence of a Chinese-government campaign to spread disinformation about the protests in Hong Kong, which began in June by calling for the withdrawal of an extradition bill and have since widened in scope, demanding democratic reforms.

If you pull up the hashtag #HongKong on TikTok, you’ll find plenty of videos, but few, if any, about the protests. The hashtag #protest elicits demonstrations from around the globe—London, Melbourne, South Africa, and, especially, India—but almost none from Hong Kong. (On Instagram, both #HongKong and #protest call up plenty of such images.) Meanwhile, a search for one of the primary Chinese-language hashtags that Hong Kong protesters have used on other platforms yields a small handful of videos, with a total of a hundred and ten thousand views. (As the Washington Post noted, in a piece investigating the relative absence of the Hong Kong protests on TikTok, videos hashtagged #snails have more than six and a half million views.) It’s true that the Hong Kong user base is not large, relatively speaking—TikTok told me that the app had fewer than a hundred and fifty thousand daily active users there—though that is the case for Twitter, too, and videos from the protests have gone viral on that platform. TikTok is generally thought of as a place for goofing off rather than for engaging in political discourse, and a TikTok executive dismissed the idea that the company was manually or algorithmically suppressing Hong Kong-related content. But one of the risks of giving our attention to entertainment governed by privately controlled algorithms is that those who own the algorithms will always be able to say that they are merely delivering what we want to see.

A platform designed for viral communication will never naturally be politics-free. In August, a new sort of video started appearing on Douyin. Uighurs in China were using the app’s editing suite to place themselves against a backdrop of loved ones who have disappeared, as sad string music plays. In one, a tearful young woman wearing a yellow shirt holds up four fingers, one for each person in the photo behind her. It may be a double signal: “four” and “death” are pronounced similarly in Mandarin. Douyin has deleted many of these videos, although, like everything that goes viral on TikTok, they have found an audience on Instagram and Twitter.

TikTok is not the first social-media app to begin its life with an air of freewheeling fun. The darker and more complicated parts of life never stay away forever. A college student from Philadelphia recently went viral with a multipart video account of her relationship with the rapper and onetime Vine star Riff Raff, which began when she was seventeen. A Miami student was arrested after his videos were interpreted as threats to shoot up schools. TikTok may figure out how to maintain or enforce a jovial vibe more effectively than its predecessors have—but, even if it does, the kids who made it popular may get bored and move on to the next thing.

Whatever comes along will likely owe something to TikTok. Facebook has already released a TikTok clone, called Lasso, which flopped, and the app researcher Jane Manchun Wong recently discovered that Instagram has been testing TikTok-like features. A.I.-powered algorithms are becoming central to the ways that we process our everyday existence. Someday, other companies could use ByteDance’s A.I. systems the way they now use Google’s cloud-computing services: like a utility—gas or electricity for the new A.I.-driven world.

“People say TikTok will run out of money, that it’s going to end up like Vine,” Bern, the marketer, said. “But TikTok has one of the biggest companies in China behind them. ByteDance is way ahead of everyone else already, in terms of the way they use A.I. They know everything about a person. They can give that person everything they want.”

In August, I took the train from Atlantic Terminal, in Brooklyn, to Patchogue, on the South Shore of Long Island, where the eighteen-city Boys of Summer teen-influencer tour was stopping for the day. It was sultry and cloudless, and as I walked up to the designated venue on Ocean Avenue I saw a pack of girls, who looked to be thirteen or fourteen, in jean shorts and braces and tube tops, and a few floppy-haired boys who looked slightly older—TikTok-famous heartthrobs named Sam and Josh and Payton, who were hugging their fans, taking selfies, accepting scrunchies as offerings and stacking them on their arms. “I love you,” the girls yelled. “I love you, too,” the guys said back. Video-making had been incorporated into this ritual in a startlingly seamless way: before one girl could finish asking a TikToker to make a video saying hi to her friend Adrianne, the TikToker was halfway through a video saying hi to her friend Adrianne.

Inside the venue, parents were drinking Michelob Ultra and staring into the middle distance. Kids were making TikToks everywhere, phones propped up on bar railings; they were moving on and off the Internet, dead serious about getting their content. In the meet-and-greet line, I talked to a blond fourteen-year-old in a white bucket hat named Dylan Hartman, who has more than half a million followers, and whose videos often feature him shirtless, brushing his hair back, lip-synching to rap. “That’s the one they all want to marry,” a mom who was chaperoning her daughter and a friend whispered to me. Another TikToker, Grasyn Hull, was wearing a “Virginity Rocks” shirt that a fan had given him. “I make memes and stuff, and I just blew up,” Hull said.

The crowd was almost entirely female, and about three-quarters of the TikTokers were male; occasionally, a sharp hormonal whiff of agony and longing would enter the air. Nearly everyone was white, and nearly everyone was mouthing along to hip-hop and doing viral dances, making sinuous, jerky movements. This is the way people learn to move, perhaps, when the ruling idea is that your physical presence should pop when viewed on a smartphone. I watched Zoe Laverne, a blond social-media star, make content on outstretched phones as reflexively and smoothly as a President shakes hands along a receiving line.

Then the lights went down and the children started screaming. The m.c. asked us to raise our left hands and promise, in unison, to have a “lit time.” Later, in line at the merch table, I talked to a thirteen-year-old girl named Beau, from New Jersey, who told me that a good TikToker was someone who “did things that made you want to watch them.” She’d been on short-form-video platforms since the third grade, when she downloaded Musical.ly. Many of the kids I talked to said that TikTok made them feel connected to other people their age. The memes surfaced glancing sensations that might otherwise be forgotten, or stay private: what it was like to sit in the back seat while your mom drove around listening to Calvin Harris; what it was like to be little, and sleepless, standing nervously outside your parents’ bedroom door at 3 A.M.

I had stopped impulsively checking TikTok after a month—I already have enough digital tools to insure that I never need to sit alone with the simple fact of being alive. But I could understand being thirteen and feeling like the world would be better if as many people as possible could be seen by as many people as possible all the time. I could imagine experiencing a social platform as a vast, warm ocean of affection and excitement, even if that ocean needed money that it could generate only by persuading you not to leave. I wondered how many baby siblings of these TikTok fanatics were at home, sitting in front of iPads, adrift in an endless stream of YouTube videos. Perhaps the time had come to let the algorithm treat the rest of us like babies, too. Maybe it knows more about what we like than we do. Maybe it knows that if it can capture our attention for long enough it won’t have to ask us what we like anymore. It will have already decided. ♦

Budget 2019: MGNREGA, PMAY allocation dip slightly, overall budget for rural welfare schemes raised by 4.4%
3-4 minutes

NEW DELHI: The government has raised the budgetary allocation for flagship welfare schemes under the Rural Development Ministry to Rs 1.17 lakh crore and reduced funds for rural employment scheme MGNREGA and PMAY (rural) for the 2019-2020 fiscal.

The revised estimate for rural welfare schemes in 2018-19 was Rs 1.12 lakh crore.

According to the budget document, the allocation for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme (MNREGA) was decreased from Rs 60,000 crore for 2019-20 fiscal from 2018-19 revised estimate of Rs 61,084 crore.

The provision for Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (rural) for 2019-20 fiscal declined to Rs 19,000 crore from the 2018-19 revised estimate of Rs 19,900 crore.

PMAY is a flagship scheme of the government for achieving the 'housing for all' objective by 2022. The government aims to provide 1.95 crore more homes by the end 2021-22 financial year.

Referring to 'housing for all' in her budget speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said, "A total of 1.54 crore rural homes have been completed in the last five years. In the second phase of PMAY-G, during 2019-20 to 2021-22, 1.95 crore houses are proposed to be provided to eligible beneficiaries."

She further said these houses will have amenities such as toilets, electricity and LPG connections.

"With the use of technology, the DBT platform and technology inputs, average number of days for completion of houses has reduced from 314 days in 2015-16 to 114 days in 2017-18," the minister said.

The government has substantially raised the allocation of funds for National Livelihood Mission to Rs 9,024 crore for the current fiscal compared to revised estimate of Rs 5,783 crore for the last fiscal.

For Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna, the allocation has been increased to Rs 19,000 crore from Rs 15,500 crore in the same period.

The fund for Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM) also jumped to Rs 800 crore from Rs 451 crore during the period under purview.

Sitharaman also announced special loan for women of self-help groups (SHG) under MUDRA scheme, saying this government has supported and encouraged women entrepreneurship through various other such schemes such as Stand up India and the Self Help Group (SHG) movement.

"In order to further encourage women enterprise, I propose to expand the Women SHG interest subvention programme to all districts. Furthermore, for every verified women SHG member having a Jan Dhan Bank Account, an overdraft of Rs 5,000 shall be allowed. One woman in every SHG will also be made eligible for a loan up to 1 lakh under the MUDRA scheme," she said.

Emphasising that the budget provides adequate funds for all welfare schemes under the ministry, Rural Development Secretary Amarjeet Sinha said the MGNREGA and PMAY are demand-based schemes, if more funds are required then that can be made availed from NABARD.

Sinha further said last year too, when addition funds were sought for the MGNREGA, it was provided by the government.

Rare Genetic Mutation Lets Some People Function with Less Sleep
Katherine Harmon
4-5 minutes

For something so essential and basic, sleep has turned out to be a complicated biological nightmare for scientists. Certain genes, such as CLOCK and BMAL1, have been pegged for their roles in the body's circadian rhythm, but the full cast of characters involved in moderating the process of sleep remains fuzzy.

But thanks to a mother and daughter who share a rare genetic mutation—and who routinely need just six hours of sleep a night—researchers have recently taken a step forward in the journey to unravel the tangled genetic web of sleep.

The new study, published online today in Science, reports the discovery of a genetic mutation on the gene DEC2 that appears to allow the mother–daughter pair of "short sleepers"—and a handful of transgenic mice—to truly need less sleep.

"We know sleep is necessary for survival," says co-author Ying-Hui Fu, a professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco. But, "we don't know anything about how it's regulated," she adds.

Sleep requirements seem to follow a typical curve in the general population, with most people needing between seven and eight hours nightly. Only about 5 percent of the population can get by just fine on six hours of sleep, notes Fu.

"In normal sleepers, if you reduce their duration to six hours, after a few days you will see some negative impact," explains Mehdi Tafti, an associate professor at the Center for Integrative Genomics at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, who wrote the accompanying perspectives piece and wasn't involved in the study. "And no one should sleep-deprive him or herself."

Despite only getting an average of 6.25 hours of sleep a night in the study, both the 17-year-old daughter and the mother in her late 40s seemed to be perfectly healthy and well-rested, Fu notes. "They feel just fine," she says. Unlike the rest of their family members (who needed an average of about eight hours of slumber), they had a mutation on the DEC2 transcription facilitator, which is involved in the circadian clock, among other functions. But was this the sole cause of the curtailed sleep needs?

To further investigate the gene and its impact on the body, the researchers studied transgenic mice with the introduced mutation. These experimental animals experienced a daily activity period about 1.2 hours longer than their nonmutant compatriots. Removing Dec2 in mice, however, did not generate the same wakefulness, and instead the genetic knockout mice actually slept a little bit more.

The underlying question, Tafti says, is how much sleep do people really need? Could most people do just fine on seven hours or do some really need to slumber for a full nine? In order to sleep less, people would need to sleep better—that is, more efficiently, with more intense REM states, Tafti explains, which appears to be happening in those with the DEC2 mutation. "We believe that short-sleepers have more efficient sleep," he says.

Even though this mutation is exceedingly rare, even in short-sleepers (Tafti estimates the total at less than 1 percent of short-sleepers), and it didn't turn up in any of the 250 control individuals tested), Fu is still hopeful that the discovery will pay off in the future. She says the find is "an opportunity to start looking into the pathways and whether we can modify that in the future." Indeed, she and her colleagues are already investigating other genes.

Tafti expects a long road still ahead before scientists solidly understand sleep. "It's a complex phenotype," he says, which is "probably the result of many, many genes—and the environment."

In the future discoveries like this one may play a role in developing treatments for those who have sleep disorders, or just help regular people get by with less sleep. "Decades from now, we can act on that pathway and make sleep more efficient," Tafti notes.

Fu says helping people sleep a little less while maintaining their health and well-being is her ultimate dream.

Scotland’s chilling new blasphemy law

Comments

The new Hate Crime Bill proposed by the Scottish Government is a sweeping threat to freedom of speech and conscience. The draft law radically expands the power of the state to punish expression and expression-adjacent behaviour, such as possession of ‘inflammatory material’. It provides for the prosecution of ill-defined ‘organisations’ (and individuals within them) and could even see actors and directors prosecuted if a play they perform is considered to contain a hate crime.

Its schedule of protected characteristics is extended beyond race (which covers ethnicity, national origin and citizenship) to include age, disability, ‘religion or… perceived religious affiliation’, sexual orientation, transgender identity and ‘variations in sex characteristics’. If the Bill is passed, Scotland would become the most aggressive regulator of citizens’ speech in the United Kingdom and one of the most aggressive in democratic Europe.

I have already written about the general flaws in this Bill, the brainchild of Scotland’s Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf, but let’s focus today on the question of religion. The National Secular Society (NSS) initially welcomed the Bill as it removed the offence of blasphemy from Scots law.

Now, the NSS’s Chris Sloggett warns the Bill’s provisions on religious hatred risk enacting ‘a de facto clampdown on freedom of expression’. The Hate Crime Bill is drafted in such a way that in abolishing the old offence of blasphemy, it threatens to introduce a new, more wide-ranging one. If you hate religion and want to encourage others to do the same, you’ll have to do it on the other side of the border.

The problems begin with a new offence of ‘stirring up hatred’ that the Bill creates. It will become a crime to ‘behave in a threatening or abusive manner or communicate threatening or abusive material to another person’ based on their perceived religious affiliation.

Unlike the 2006 Racial and Religious Hatred Act, which made it a crime to ‘stir up religious hatred’ in England and Wales, the Scottish Bill does not require intent. All the Crown has to prove is that ‘it is likely that hatred will be stirred up’ by the accused’s words or deeds. The maximum penalty will be up to seven years in prison and/or a fine.

Sloggett points to Boris Johnson’s infamous burqa column as an example of speech about followers of a religion which, though objectionable to many, would be ‘ludicrous’ to prosecute. Yet under this Bill, anyone repeating the language of the Prime Minister would surely face a smart knock on the door at the very least. Even if they weren’t prosecuted in the end, the thought of a visit from the police would be enough to make many self-censor.

While behaving in ‘a threatening, abusive or insulting manner’ towards a racial group will make you liable for prosecution under the Bill, on other characteristics such as religion only ‘threatening’ or ‘abusive’ conduct will be criminal. There is also a ‘freedom of expression’ clause which purports to protect ‘discussion or criticism’ of religion, but neither of these factors is terribly reassuring.

The irreligious or opponents of a particular religion will ask why they aren’t permitted to abuse a belief system or the people who adhere to it. For some, their political ideology is as intrinsic to their identity and personal dignity as Christianity is to a Roman Catholic. If it will be forbidden to abuse Christianity and Christians, why shouldn’t it be forbidden also to abuse Scottish nationalism and Scottish nationalists?

Criticism of religion is seldom neat or nice. Monty Python’s Life of Brian was not a scholarly disquisition on the scientific impossibility of raising the dead and walking on water. It was a viciously ribald assault on organised Christianity, its Scriptures, theology and practitioners. Yes, it was satire but the film was still greeted by protests and demands from Christians that it be banned. They considered it blasphemous yet, give the option, they would probably have considered it ‘threatening’ or ‘abusive’ too.

And what about plain old hatred? Not witty or satirical or dreamt up by some Footlights alumnus up for the Edinburgh Fringe. I mean straightforward loathing: ‘Islam is a terrorist religion’, ‘the Catholic Church is a child abuse cult’, or ‘Haredi Jews are wife-beating fanatics’. These are hateful things to say and it’s perhaps ‘likely that hatred will be stirred up’ by someone saying them, but should they result in a jail term?

This is why the Bill’s ‘freedom of expression’ exemption is so unsatisfactory. In telling us we may ‘criticise’ religion and the religious but not ‘abuse’ them, the Scottish Government is instructing us in how we may speak about religion. The power of heresy often lies in the vehemence of its rhetoric and its ability to scandalise and even deeply wound believers. Those who despise Christianity consider its teachings silly, wrong, even dangerous, and revile its undue influence and standing in public life. They mean to abuse it. They want it to feel threatened. Yousaf is telling people it’s okay to blaspheme as long as they use their indoor voice.

The Hate Crime Bill is more radical and more authoritarian than the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act, now happily repealed. If MSPs pass it in its current form, they will spend much of the next session of the Scottish Parliament amending or repealing it. Fair warning, I plan to return to the Bill’s myriad flaws but the religious hatred provision is one of the major ones. Humza Yousaf, in his desire to be progressive and enlightened, has managed to reverse-engineer a blasphemy law to replace the one he is repealing.

No it’s not your money: why taxation isn’t theft
6-8 minutes

tax is theftA guest blog by Philip Goff.

No it’s not your money

Why taxation isn’t theft

Many political arguments start from the assumption that taxation is the government taking ‘our money’ off us. When austerity hit the arts in 2011, Dr Steve Davies of the pseudo-think-tank the Institute of Economic Affairs argued on Channel Four news [TJN: a mainstream UK television current affairs programme] that the 20% cuts to the arts didn’t go far enough: art funding should be entirely abolished on the grounds that it’s unfair to take people’s money off them by force to pay for something they may not want. Again and again the economic right stoke resentment at the state allegedly taking what’s ours by force, and use this resentment to build support for a programme of small government.

But even those who believe in relatively big government tend to share this understanding of taxation as the appropriation by government of ‘our money’. Most on the economic left start from the assumption that it is all things being equal a bad thing that the state takes our money from us, but hold that this prima facie bad is justified by the public goods which taxation makes possible. Well-meaning [UK] public intellectual Alain de Botton encourages us to think of taxation as charity: we give up what’s ours for the greater good of our society.

So both sides tend to agree that one has some kind of right or entitlement to one’s pre-tax income. The economic right believe that the right to pre-tax income is inalienable, or at least that it is trumped only by the absolute necessity of providing the basic requirements of society, such as roads and rule of law. In contrast, the economic left tend to value the good of making society more equal, or of providing a basic standard of living for all, above the good of letting people keep their own money.

This feeling that your pre-tax income is ‘your money’ is difficult to shake. It’s hard not to see the pre-tax figure on your payslip as representing what’s really owing to you for the work you’ve done, and hence to feel that the state is taking away from you something that is yours by right. However, a little careful reflection shows this almost universal assumption to be utterly confused. There is no sense in which you have a right to your pre-tax income.

To see this, we have to ask what kind of right it might be supposed one has to one’s pre-tax income. Presumably, it is either a legal right or a moral right. Once we separate out these alternatives, we can see that the former option is incoherent, whilst the latter is utterly implausible.

You clearly don’t have a legal right to your pre-tax income, as you are legally obliged to pay tax on it. This is a simple analytic truth that follows from the definition of taxation. People who don’t take pay their taxes go (or at least legally ought to go) to gaol.

So if there is a general right to one’s pre-tax income, then it must be a moral right. But it is implausible to suppose that each person has a moral right to his or her pre-tax income, for that would imply that the distribution of pre-tax incomes the market happens to throw up is perfectly just, and this is clearly not the case. There is no justice in the fact that the pre-tax income of a City banker is many hundreds of times the pre-tax income of scientist working on a cure for cancer. This is just an accident of the way our market economy is structured. To hold that each person has a moral right to their pre-tax income would be to hold that the market economy just happens to deliver to each person exactly what they deserve, and this is clearly not the case.

Perhaps there are specific cases in which a person happens to deserve their pre-tax income; these would be rare and happy co-incidences in which the market happens to deliver exactly what is deserved. But the mere fact that your pre-tax income is £X does not entail that in any morally significant sense you are entitled to £X. The money the market happens to throw at you is not necessarily the money you deserve. No doubt you have worked hard for that money; no doubt you have made a contribution to the public good; you have special talents that others lack, etc. But others also work hard/are talented/make a contribution, and the market has not taken these morally significant factors into consideration in working out what to give to whom. For better or worse it’s almost certainly not fair that you have what you have relative to what others have got.

It’s the responsibility of law makers, then, not to respect pre-tax incomes, but to disrespect pre-tax incomes. Insofar as the market fails to yield a just distribution of incomes, the state should work to correct that distribution. Of course, to some degree the scope for such correction will be limited by economic realities. The pragmatic argument between right and left as to the relationship between tax levels and incentives to work or invest is a perfectly sensible one. But it is crucial to distinguish the pragmatic argument of the economic right, ‘We must lower taxes in order to encourage investment’, from the moral argument of the economic right ‘We must lower taxes in order to give people more of their money’. The former argument is based on an empirical claim which stands or falls with the data. The latter argument is based on the wholly confused notion that there is something morally significant about the distribution of incomes the market happens to have thrown up.

Your pre-tax income isn’t the money you deserve; it is the money the amoral market has gifted you. A government may have cause to respect the whims of the market as a matter of practical necessity. But the state has no moral reason to respect the whims of the market. The only legitimate bar to redistribution is economic reality. Any politician who thinks it a good thing, in and of itself, to give people more of ‘their money’ is confused.

(A similar argument is made at length in ‘The Myth of Ownership’ by Murphy and Nagel, published by Oxford University Press).

"If the goal was to get rid of poverty, we failed": the legacy of the 1996 welfare reform
Dylan Matthews@dylanmattdylan@vox.com
49-62 minutes

Presidents are usually effusive, grandiose, and triumphant when they sign major legislation that will form a huge part of their legacy. In 1996, Bill Clinton’s announcement that he’d sign a bill ending "welfare as we know it" was not that.

It was defensive and at times openly apologetic for what was about to happen.

"Some parts of this bill still go too far," he conceded. "This bill still cuts deeper than it should in nutritional assistance, mostly for working families with children."

He probably didn’t know then how true those words would one day turn out to be. Clinton, and now his wife, presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, has run hot and cold over the years on the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act (PRWORA) — what is now colloquially referred to as "welfare reform."

Ten years after signing the bill, Bill took an enthusiastic victory lap in the pages of the New York Times. "Welfare reform has proved a great success," he declared. And at first, it seemed like he was right. Evidence seemed to indicate that it really did increase employment, and worst-case scenarios liberal critics predicted didn’t come to pass.

But another 10 years later, the mood changed again. Days before the New York Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton, who once urged her husband to sign the bill, told WNYC that "we have to take a hard look at it again." New research had showed that in fact welfare reform fell short in the depths of the Great Recession — substantially increasing deep poverty and leaving families who can’t find work without any cash safety net.

The Clintons’ statements have mirrored the overall reputation of the bill over time, especially among Democrats. In 1996 the party was all but unanimous about the fact that something had to change with welfare. There was heated debate over whether the changes were acceptable, including within the Clinton administration itself, but ultimately most congressional Democrats voted for the law on the same mixed grounds that Clinton signed it: It wasn’t perfect, but it was a necessary step toward reform.

Now it is a cross Hillary has had to bear during her presidential run, and a topic on which Bernie Sanders and his left-wing intellectual supporters could, and did, attack her mercilessly.

The idea behind welfare reform back in the '90s was that something was deeply broken about the system and needed to change. That was correct. But something else is deeply broken now, and it too needs to change.
Keeping people out of work was a feature, not a bug, of the original welfare program

What we talk about when we talk about welfare is the Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) program, enacted as part of the Social Security Act of 1935 in the midst of the Great Depression.

This program was initially an outgrowth of a type of program that cropped up in a number of states, known as Mothers' Pensions, in the 1910s. The programs were meant to help single mothers, but only the small fraction deemed deserving.

"That typically excluded divorced mothers and those with children born outside marriage," New York Times reporter Jason DeParle writes in his book American Dream: Three Women, Ten Kids, and a Nation's Drive to End Welfare, which informs much of the history in this article. "And it almost always excluded racial minorities." Indeed, the recipients of Mothers' Pensions were 96 percent white.

ADC too initially excluded black mothers, as did Social Security's flagship old-age pension program. It built on the Mothers' Pension system by providing funding for states to pursue their own programs, with states setting benefit levels and many of the rules. Gradually, federal oversight increased, first with a push in the 1940s and '50s by federal authorities to end racial discrimination.

By 1960, DeParle notes, the program was 40 percent black, and while the program initially targeted widows to the exclusion of divorcées and unwed mothers, almost two-thirds of recipients by that year fell in the latter category. ADC was renamed the Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program in 1962.

The purpose of these programs, from the beginning, was to deter women from work. After all, it was originally designed for white widows, a population deemed deserving of aid and one expected to stay home and raise children rather than enter the workforce.

But work by black mothers was more common, and more expected, especially in Southern states that relied on black women's labor as maids, nannies, and agricultural workers. That fed an expectation that black women should be working even if they had children, which in turn fed an anti-welfare backlash.

The backlash was worsened by rapid increases in the rolls, beginning as racial discrimination eased in the 1950s. It was also aided by the rise of the "welfare rights movement" in the 1960s, which organized to enroll poor people then cut off from the program and won important legal victories like King v. Smith, which established AFDC as an entitlement that all eligible people must be allowed to receive:
Fang and Keane 2004

The two most vocal leaders of the welfare rights movement — sociologists Frances Fox Piven and Richard Cloward — described their goal as overwhelming the system until the government was forced to enact a guaranteed income, a policy that then gaining traction both with economists and with activists like Martin Luther King Jr.

They almost got their wish: Richard Nixon proposed a welfare reform package called the Family Assistance Plan that would have included a guaranteed income — albeit one that recipients would have to meet work requirements to get. The bill passed the House before dying due to both liberal opposition (because it was too stingy) and conservative opposition (because it was a guaranteed income).

Contrary to popular belief, Lyndon B. Johnson’s war on poverty did not, Columbia professor Jane Waldfogel writes, do much to expand AFDC. Johnson hated the idea of poverty reduction through handouts rather than work, and resisted calls from his adviser Sargent Shriver to implement a guaranteed income.
Old welfare really did keep people out of work — and those on it wanted to work
Sign says: "Silver Rights Now, Jobs for All, Support Hawkins-Humphrey Bill"
Many on the left preferred guaranteed jobs to welfare; this demonstration in the 1970s, featuring Jesse Jackson, for the Humphrey-Hawkins proposal to guarantee jobs is an early example of demonstrators making that case.

Thomas J. O'Halloran

The anti-welfare, pro–work requirement movement really came into its own in the 1980s. Ronald Reagan had campaigned against the program, railing against "welfare queens" living large and driving Cadillacs, and slashed AFDC by about a sixth upon taking office.

He was buffeted by a growing community of conservative think tanks, and most influentially by political scientist Charles Murray, who first made his name with his 1984 book Losing Ground, which argued that abolishing welfare entirely would actually reduce poverty.

Reputable social scientists dismissed the book, but its racially charged conclusions struck a chord. In his book proposal for Losing Ground, Murray wrote, "Why can a publisher sell it? Because a huge number of well-meaning whites fear that they are closet racists, and this book tells them they are not. It's going to make them feel better about things they already think but do not know how to say." He wasn’t wrong.

With enemies like that, many on the left were understandably suspicious of attacks on welfare. But the program really did have deep problems. The three most common criticisms made of AFDC were:

    It caused poor adults who could work to not work.
    It caused dependency; rather than using it as a temporary safety net, some people embraced it as a way of life.
    It encouraged having children out of wedlock and discouraged marriage.

The first of these claims was definitely true, the second was kind of true, and the last might have been true but the effect was very, very small.

Very few social policy analysts would contest that AFDC discouraged work. For one thing, it often featured a 100 percent phaseout rate: Each dollar you earned meant one less dollar in benefits.

"I'd always talk about it in intro econ classes," Hilary Hoynes, an economist at UC Berkeley, says. "Students come in thinking welfare recipients are lazy, and then you talk them through the basics of the economics and describe the incentives of the program, and people were like, 'Of course, why would you work in this program?'"

Ironically, one thing Reagan did upon taking office was increase the phaseout rate, therefore making AFDC an even worse work deterrent than it had been before. "Reagan's cuts cut all the working people off and made it a program for people who weren't working," the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities' Liz Schott explains.
Edin and Lein’s influential book Making Ends Meet.
Russell Safe Foundation

Ethnographic work by Kathryn Edin (now at Johns Hopkins) and Laura Lein (now at University of Michigan) in the early 1990s suggested that AFDC both provided inadequate benefits for the poor, leaving them mired in poverty, and provided significant work disincentives. The phaseout rate, they concluded, was a major deterrent.

"Most of the welfare-reliant mothers we interviewed had an accurate view of the benefits they would lose by going to work," Edin and Lein write in their book Making Ends Meet. "They made reasonable assessments of how much they would need to earn to offset the added costs of work."

The families they spoke with concluded that low-wage jobs would at best leave them no better off than they were with welfare, that it might leave them worse off if they lost their job and were forced to reapply for welfare, and that the jobs they could realistically get would not prepare them for better, higher-paying work in the future.

But because of the stinginess of AFDC, Edin and Lein found that welfare mothers still needed to find other sources of income. Only about 64 percent of their income came from AFDC, food stamps, and other safety net programs. Twelve percent came from off-the-books work (which wouldn't reduce welfare benefits) and underground work (selling sex, drugs, etc.), and 17 percent came from friends and family members. Only 2 percent came from formal work.

Some economists I talked to were more skeptical that the phaseout rates were the major problem — but still agreed that AFDC discouraged work. "Congress lowered the phaseout rate from 100 percent to 67 percent in 1967 and work levels among AFDC recipients went up only modestly," Robert Moffitt at Johns Hopkins notes. The bigger work disincentive, he says, was the mere fact that people were getting money with no strings attached.

Even though few welfare recipients were formally working, research indicated they actually wanted to be working. "Research indicated, including research that we conducted in Chicago, that AFDC recipients preferred work to welfare and would readily accept jobs that will not result in slipping deeper into poverty," according to William Julius Wilson, a professor and sociologist at Harvard University.

What about the claim that AFDC caused dependency? The most influential work on that question was done by Harvard’s Mary Jo Bane and David Ellwood in the 1980s. They found that while most people who entered AFDC left fairly quickly, a minority stayed for long periods, averaging eight years. Though a minority of those entering, because of its longer duration this group made up the majority of the AFDC caseload at any given time.

Moreover, plenty of research has documented that there was a correlation between mothers receiving AFDC and their daughters receiving it later; the literature is split on whether this was causal (the mom getting welfare actually made the daughter more likely to take it up) or whether it was wholly explained by the fact that children of poor parents tend to be poor too.

The best, most recent research I’ve seen on this question, from the University of Kentucky’s James Ziliak, Robert Paul Hartley, and Carlos Lamarche, finds that at least some of the relationship was causal.

Reasonable people can disagree about how bad it was that a majority of AFDC recipients at any given time were in the midst of a years-long spell. After all, that was the original intent of Mothers’ Pensions: that the money could support mothers indefinitely, that they’d never need to work. But it’s hard to deny that the program did lead to millions of people living off welfare for years at a time, without working.

As for the claim that welfare discouraged traditional families, the evidence there is shakiest. Christopher Jencks, a professor of social policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, tells me the argument that welfare discouraged marriage "was probably a little true, but not very." The effect sizes just weren't big enough.

And the phenomenon seemed to be largely about women preferring to rely on their welfare checks than on the earnings of their male partner — it was about independence as much as anything.

As the welfare backlash grew in the 1980s, the federal government was beginning to issue waivers to states to allow them to experiment with various welfare-to-work approaches. A number of governors, notably Gov. Tommy Thompson (R-WI), seized the opportunity, experimenting with work supports, time limits, work requirements, and other approaches that would inspire the latter federal reforms.

The waiver programs were often run as actual experiments, and the results were encouraging. "Out of 11 state programs studied, nine raised employment and earnings, albeit modestly," DeParle recalls.

For example, the organization MDRC produced a hugely influential study in 1993 of a welfare-to-work program in Riverside County, California, which found that the Riverside approach (which emphasized getting a job above all else, including education and training) raised earnings more than 50 percent. That fueled a burgeoning consensus that liberals should accede to work requirements and accept some form of "workfare."

(Subsequent research suggested the Riverside finding was a fluke, the product of an already stronger local economy rather than any reforms.)

The liberal pro-reform line was that assisting the poor was worthwhile but that AFDC had unacceptable work disincentives, and that a public jobs program would be superior. Mickey Kaus at the New Republic was the most vocal journalistic exponent of this view, while Ellwood's 1988 book Poor Support laid out the most sophisticated, detailed plan for achieving a liberal version of reform, including greatly expanded health benefits, child care, and guaranteed jobs, alongside time limits on receipt of actual cash welfare.

Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton was strongly associated with this approach, putting together "the Clinton plan" through his role as chair of the welfare task force at the National Governors Association. The plan sought $1 billion to $2 billion more a year in spending, in exchange for tougher work requirements. Every governor in the country save one endorsed it.

The plan eventually morphed into the Family Support Act, which provided additional matching funds in exchange for sending a certain fraction of the recipients to work programs. Reagan signed it into law in 1988, but it didn't stop the welfare rolls from continuing to grow.
How Democrats came around to the idea of reforming welfare — and why Bill Clinton signed it

"Welfare should be a second chance, not a way of life. In a Clinton administration, we're going to put an end to welfare as we know it," said then-Gov. Clinton in October 1991.

From the get-go, he was passionate about expanding time limits and work requirements and trying to dramatically reduce the welfare rolls.

Still, a number of liberal welfare experts who joined his administration, including Georgetown law professor Peter Edelman, the Kennedy School's Bane, and Ellwood, would be tasked with developing the Clinton welfare plan, alongside the more vociferously anti-welfare aide and speechwriter Bruce Reed.

Almost immediately, it became clear that the idealized grand bargain, in which every welfare recipient would get a subsidized job if needed, along with child care and transportation assistance and everything else they might need to thrive in the workforce, wasn't going to fly. The costs were too much for Congress to stomach, even more so after Republicans regained power in 1995.

"By just mailing checks, the government spent an average of about $5,000 per family each year," DeParle notes. "A work slot (with child care for just one child) would cost about $11,700. The bill for 2 million of them would raise welfare's annual costs by more than $13 billion, nearly 50 percent. Nothing like that seemed remotely possible."

Congressional Republicans began putting together proposals that took the time limits that Ellwood had wanted to pair with very generous government support, and just imposed them without any of that help on the side. In the official House GOP plan, states could totally cut off recipients after three years in a work program.

Under a conservative alternative known as the Real Welfare Reform Act, women under 26 with children out of marriage would be stripped of all AFDC, food stamps, and housing assistance. Just like that.

And, DeParle reports, the Clinton administration task force charged with building out a plan was growing more supportive of hard time limits, much to Ellwood's concern. An idea he saw as part of a comprehensive expansion of the safety net was being transformed beyond recognition.

Eventually, Clinton's team put out a plan in June 1994. It limited cash benefits to two years and required participants to work after that; if they couldn't find work, a government job would be provided. To keep costs down, it only applied to people born after 1971: those 23 and under, at the time.

Once the GOP was back in control of the House and Senate, Speaker Newt Gingrich quickly settled on the idea of block-granting AFDC. Instead of the federal government matching state spending, the feds would grant a set amount of cash every year, which states could then use as they liked to implement a welfare programs.

States would be given huge amounts of discretion as to whether to use those funds for job training, child care, etc. This allowed Congress to avoid getting too specific and gelled nicely with the Republicans' general support of localized governance.

Initially, the Republican plan didn't appear to have much in the way of work requirements — something Democrats, of all people, attacked them for, calling them "weak on work." To get around that, the bill got work requirements but also something known as a "caseload reduction credit," which let states count people who left welfare as working whether they really had a job or not. Just by cutting the rolls, states could meet the requirement.

The Democratic opposition continued to buy into Republican policy ideas, with House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt proposing a four-year cold turkey time limit for aid and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle proposing five years. And Bill Clinton was sounding sympathetic to even Republican proposals.

Wendell Primus, a deeply respected appointee to the Department of Health and Human Services who vociferously opposed to cuts to welfare, produced an estimate suggesting the Republicans' Senate bill would push 1.1 million people into poverty. Clinton saw the study, but nonetheless privately suggested he'd sign such a bill anyway.

He got temporarily saved from himself by Gingrich's own blunders. In November and December 1995, Gingrich packaged welfare reform together with a broader balanced budget package that included substantial cuts to Medicare, proposed in the midst of two government shutdowns over broader spending-level issues. When Clinton vetoed the spending cuts, he vetoed the attached welfare reform. In January, he vetoed it on its own.

Humiliated, Gingrich initially didn't want to try for reform again, DeParle reports, until Jimmy Hayes, a House member who switched in 1996 from the Democrats to Republicans, told him that forcing Clinton to veto or sign a standalone welfare bill would put the Democrats in a deep political bind. If Clinton vetoed, he'd be painted as soft on welfare. If he signed, Democrats would rebel. So in July, the House and Senate passed a standalone bill and sent it to the president.

DeParle reports that the administration was split over whether to sign, but more appeared to support a veto than not. Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala wanted a veto, Secretary of Labor Robert Reich wanted a veto, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin wanted a veto, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Henry Cisneros wanted a veto, Chief of Staff Leon Panetta wanted a veto.

David Ellwood, who had resigned from the administration in 1995, urged a veto. Same for political aides George Stephanopoulos and Harold Ickes. On the pro side were Reed, Al Gore, and Rahm Emanuel, arguing that the president couldn't afford to be seen keeping a failed system going.

Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY) famously predicted "children sleeping on grates, picked up in the morning frozen."

Clinton signed the bill, in the process renaming AFDC the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). In response, HHS officials Primus, Peter Edelman, and Mary Jo Bane resigned in protest. Edelman, a longtime personal friend of the Clintons, wrote a long piece for the Atlantic calling welfare reform the "worst thing Bill Clinton has done."
At first, welfare reform seemed to be working as intended

Clinton and congressional Republicans had picked just about the best possible time to enact a law like this. The late '90s were an era of extreme labor market tightness that has not been seen since. Unemployment dipped below 4 percent at times. Even many of the least-skilled former AFDC recipients could find work.

Add to that the fact that Clinton had pushed through a huge expansion in the earned income tax credit (EITC), which made low-wage work considerably more attractive, and you had a scenario where the aftermath of welfare reform could see poverty actually fall.

And fall it did. Here's how the anchored supplemental poverty measure — a more accurate metric for deprivation than the official poverty measure — changed from 1993 to 2002:

And welfare enrollment fell dramatically:
Welfare reform, change in welfare case loads Congressional Research Service / Gene Falk

What’s more, it appears that the relationship was at least somewhat causal. Welfare reform really did appear to be decreasing caseloads and increasing earnings and employment. Typically, researchers found that the EITC and the growing economy did more, but welfare reform played a role all the same. "Some women who were on welfare really did have enough work skills to get a decent job at wages above the minimum wage, and they are probably better off off welfare," Moffitt says.

For example, in one influential paper the University of Chicago's Jeffrey Grogger estimated that time limits caused about one-eighth of the decline in welfare use and 7 percent of the rise in employment among single mothers from 1993 to 1999 — less than the EITC, but still significant.

More dramatically, in 2004 Hanming Fang (now at Penn) and Michael P. Keane (now at Oxford) estimated that work requirements and time limits explained 68 percent of the decrease in welfare usage and 27 percent of the increase in workforce participation among single mothers. Once again, EITC was a bigger factor in workforce participation, but welfare reform still mattered.

Most impressively, in 2000, University of Wisconsin's Rebecca Blank (later Obama's acting commerce secretary) and the University of Michigan’s Robert Schoeni found a rise in total income and decline in poverty for most affected by the 1996 reforms.

"Welfare reform is now widely viewed as one of the greatest successes of contemporary social policy," Jencks and Scott Winship wrote in a 2004 piece.

In that, he’s joined by most social policy experts I consulted for this piece. While conservatives still defend the 1996 reforms, there’s a broad consensus outside the law’s core supporters that something went deeply wrong, and that the initial assessments were way too optimistic.

For one thing, subsequent research cast doubt on the original pro-reform studies. The best, most recent review of the literature I've seen comes from the University of Kentucky's James Ziliak, a veteran researcher on welfare policy issues. It was finalized in late 2015 and incorporates not just the initial rush of research into welfare reform post-1996 but studies since the Great Recession began as well.

Ziliak agrees with prior research that while you can certainly debate the relative importance of welfare reform compared with the EITC and the business cycle, TANF and its associated rules almost certainly caused a decrease in the welfare rolls and increased employment. He also finds a relative consensus that it increased earnings.

For most family structure–related outcomes — teen births, marriage, etc. — the evidence was too limited and mixed to draw firm conclusions.

But Ziliak also concludes that welfare reform reduced the incomes of the poor, when you take both the increase in earnings and the decline in transfer income into account, and especially if you look at the poorest of the poor. In other words, transitioning from welfare to work may have gotten people jobs, but those people didn't actually come out ahead monetarily. Welfare would've paid better than work did.

Specific studies finding this include one by Ziliak himself, with Kentucky colleagues Christopher Bollinger and Luis Gonzalez, which concludes, "The earnings gains among the low skilled a decade after the implementation of TANF and expansions of the EITC have been more than offset by losses in transfer income and have left the most vulnerable single mothers either running in place or falling behind."

Bitler, Hoynes, and Penn's Jonah Gelbach looked at the Connecticut Jobs First waiver experiment, a pre-TANF reform effort with many similar characteristics to federal welfare reform, and found reductions in total income for participants at the bottom at the income distribution. That study is particularly compelling since it was an actual experiment with random assignment.

Ziliak also points out flaws in some of the earlier research suggesting welfare reform reduced poverty. Blank and Schoeni’s paper, for instance, excluded those reporting no earnings and income, which might have made the overall population appear better off than it really was.

"While the official poverty rate fell among single mother families in the 5 years after reform, this is less in evidence over the long term, especially for broader definitions of income that include in-kind transfers like SNAP [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps] and tax payments and credits," Ziliak writes in an email. "We saw especially an increase in so-called deep poverty, the fraction living below 50 percent of the poverty line."

"If the goal of welfare reform was to get rid of welfare, we succeeded," the University of Wisconsin’s Timothy Smeeding notes. "If the goal was to get rid of poverty, we failed."
Welfare reform almost certainly increased deep poverty

There's the rub. Deep poverty figures tell a much less rosy story than those for overall poverty. That suggests, as Hopkins's Moffitt has argued, that welfare reform was part of a shift away from aid for the poorest of the poor and toward the highest-earning of the poor: those with jobs, who benefited from higher minimum wages and EITC.

When you look at overall poverty from 1993 to 2012 (again, measured accurately rather than through the official measure), you see that it fell substantially in the 1990s and then stayed down.

That was true even in economic downturns. In 1993, as the nation recovered from the early '90s recession, the poverty rate was nearly 21 percent. In 2012, in the wake of the worst recession in post-WWII history, it spiked up to 16 percent, a huge improvement.

The same can't be said of deep poverty. That fell in the '90s too — but by a comparatively tiny amount. And by 2012, it was back fairly close to its 1993 level:

Tellingly, the deep poverty rate in 1996, when welfare reform passed, was 4.6 percent. Since the end of the late-'90s boom in 2001, the rate has never been that low again.

If you try to isolate the effects of welfare reform, it appears that if anything it probably increased deep poverty in the US. The most disturbing evidence in this regard comes courtesy of the University of Michigan's Luke Shaefer and Johns Hopkins's Kathryn Edin, who have documented an increase in the share of Americans living on $2 a day or less in cash income.

Using data from the Survey on Income and Program Participation (SIPP), they found that the share of households with less than $2 per day, per person, shot up from 1996 to 2011, from 1.7 percent of households with children to 4.3 percent. That's a 153 percent increase.
Extreme poverty increase, 1996 to 2011 Shaefer and Edin, 2013

The growth is much smaller if you throw food stamps, tax credits, and housing subsidies into the mix, but it's still an increase of more than 45 percent: from 1.1 percent of households to 1.6 percent. That just underscores Edin and Shaefer's main point, which is that more and more families are being forced to get by without a reliable source of cash income.

And cash matters. You can't pay the rent with food stamps. You can't buy clothing for your children, or refill a subway card, or pay the car bill, or refill your gas tank either. You can't eat housing subsidies (and very few of the poor get them, in any case).

Shaefer and Edin are clear that they view this development as, in large part, a result of welfare reform. "The percentage growth in extreme poverty over our study period was greatest among vulnerable groups who were most likely to be impacted by the 1996 welfare reform," they note. Households headed by single women saw a larger increase in extreme poverty. Households with children (the only ones eligible for AFDC) saw an increase more than twice as large as the one households without children experienced.

And TANF did much less to reduce extreme poverty than AFDC did. In 1996, AFDC brought 1.15 million households above the $2-a-day threshold. In 2011, it was only bringing about 291,000 above it — and this was after more than a decade of population growth.

This conclusion is backed up by other data Shaefer and Edin present. Food stamp recipients must verify their income to the program, and misreporting can result in criminal charges, increasing the data's credibility. In 1996, 316,000 SNAP applicants reported having no income. In 2012, 1.2 million did. "Our SIPP estimates fall behind SNAP administrative data estimates as of 2012," Shaefer and Edin write, "suggesting that our SIPP estimates are on the low side."
Extreme poverty, measured through SNAP data Shaefer and Edin 2015

Shaefer and Edin also did extensive fieldwork talking to families meeting the $2-a-day threshold, reporting their findings in the book $2 a Day. They found, again and again, that the effective end of cash welfare was forcing families into desperate measures to provide for themselves.

Many people they talked to would sell plasma, one of the few ways to make quick cash when work can't be found. Others would sell their food stamps for cash — a rare practice generally, but common among the extremely poor. The one thing they couldn't do is rely on cash welfare.

"TANF is virtually dead in all of these places. It's absolutely striking that every one of our families is categorically eligible for TANF and none of them are receiving it," Edin told me. "Where it's really dead is in the imaginations and thought processes of the poor. This is not seen as a fallback. In most cases, it doesn't occur to people to apply."

The $2-a-day research has provoked a fair share of pushback from critics, but none of their arguments really refute the central conclusions. The most common argument is that SIPP underreports income, exaggerating the rate of extreme poverty.

But SIPP, Edin and Shaefer argue, suffers less from this problem than other surveys, and the fact that SNAP's data tracks SIPP so well is further evidence that something real is going on here.

Moreover, for this to explain the rise in extreme poverty, underreporting would have to increase over time — and between 1996 and 2005, it actually fell for SIPP.

In a review of Edin and Shaefer's book, Christopher Jencks from Harvard presents still more evidence of this increase in deep poverty and deterioration in living standards for the poorest of the poor. He charts how the economic resources of Americans at the 50th, 10th, 5th, and 2nd percentile of the income distribution have changed from 1967 to the present:
Christopher Jencks, extreme poverty New York Review of Books / Christopher Jencks

While people at the middle, and even the middle poor, saw their resource levels stagnate from 1999 onward, they plummeted for Americans at the 2nd percentile. This, he concludes, "support Edin and Shaefer’s claim that the poorest of the poor were a lot worse off in 2012 than in either 1996 or 1999."

Other analyses of SIPP have come to similar conclusions as Edin and Shaefer. A 2011 paper by Hopkins's Moffitt, Mathematica's Yonatan Ben-Shalom, and University of Wisconsin Madison's John Karl Scholz estimated changes in post-transfer deep poverty. They found that 4.5 percent of families were under half of the poverty line in 1993, but 6.6 percent were in 2004, a nearly 50 percent increase.

Edin and Shaefer were also building upon a rather large literature showing an increase in the number of "disconnected mothers": single moms who were neither receiving cash benefits nor in the workforce. The Urban Institute's Pamela Loprest and Austin Nichols estimated that while in 1996, one in eight low-income single mothers were disconnected — having no earnings and no TANF or Supplemental Security Income benefits, and not in school — one in five were in the years from 2004 to 2008:
Disconnected mothers increase Loprest 2012

Similarly, Wisconsin's Blank and Michigan's Brian Kovak (now at Carnegie Mellon) find that the share of single mothers with no earnings or welfare not in school doubled from 10 to 20 percent from 1990 to 2005. If you include women with very low earnings and no Social Security Insurance (SSI) income, the rate goes from 12 to 22 percent. Many of these families still received SNAP benefits, but that’s about it.

The bottom line is that a large and growing literature finds, consistently, that deep poverty defined in a variety of ways increased after the introduction of welfare reform. The increases are particularly striking among single mothers, the main group benefiting from AFDC.

It's hard to interpret this evidence as saying anything other than that welfare reform decreased living standards for the most vulnerable members of American society.
Block granting: where even conservatives think reform fell short

Welfare reform has also made welfare less responsive to recessions. This is a disturbing development given the central role that safety net programs play in assisting families and boosting the economy when unemployment rises and work is hard to come by. Because programs like food stamps are entitlements, they are guaranteed to everyone who qualifies for benefits.

As incomes fall in recessions, more people qualify and automatically start getting assistance. That's a form of automatic stimulus that is vital in helping counteract downturns and helping families cope in the meantime.

AFDC was a program like that. As an entitlement, it took all eligible people, and as the number of people qualifying rose in recessions, its ranks swelled. It had a lot of problems, but it did help counteract bad business cycles.

TANF, by contrast, is a block grant. It gives a set amount of money to states, every year, regardless of how many people are eligible for benefits. That means its ranks don't swell in recessions:
Recession responsivity of TANF Center on Budget and Policy Priorities

This means that recessions now cause a greater increase in deep poverty than occurred before welfare reform. Two recent papers by UC Davis's Marianne Bitler and UC Berkeley's Hilary Hoynes broke down how various programs have affected the "cyclicality" of poverty during the Great Recession: that is, the degree to which poverty changes in reaction to changes in unemployment. For instance, SNAP (food stamps) reduced cyclicality by giving unemployed people boosts in spending power and helping them get out of poverty.

But TANF, unique among the programs analyzed, increased cyclicality, especially for those in deep poverty. It made the deeply poor more vulnerable to changes in the business cycle. "Those at the very bottom," Hoynes says. "That's the safety net that's gone."

Harry Holzer, a labor economist at Georgetown who's widely cited on low-wage work issues, notes that "welfare reform was based on a strong assumption that almost all of the poor could get jobs. … That model really didn't work well in the Great Recession."

If that were the only problem with the block grant structure, that'd be bad enough. But the problems run much deeper than that. For one thing, the actual size of the block grant, in inflation-adjusted terms, has declined dramatically. Since 1997, the federal contribution has been frozen at $16.5 billion. But $16.5 billion in 1997 was worth a lot more than $16.5 billion is worth today. The Congressional Research Service finds that inflation has eroded a third of the value of the block grant:

By contrast, from 1997 to 2013, EITC and child tax credit payments grew by more than 50 percent. That's what's supposed to happen as the economy grows. The erosion of TANF money is legitimately an outlier, unlike what's happening to any other major safety net program.

It gets worse. Welfare reform didn't just turn AFDC into a block-granted program; it also gave states huge amount of flexibility in how to use that money. And because there's little in the way of incentives for states to use it for actual cash assistance, or even work programs, it's being plundered for use in barely related pursuits, like administration of the child protection system.

In 2014, just 26 percent of TANF spending went to "basic assistance" — cash welfare — and another 24 percent went to work programs and child care, according to a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis. A third went to activities well outside the intended function of welfare reform.

For example, Michigan has used the money for college scholarships, and Louisiana has used it to fund anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers.
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities

The availability of the money as a kind of slush fund for states — if only they don't use it on actual welfare — additionally creates an incentive for states to discourage potential beneficiaries from applying. In Georgia, applicants received flyers with slogans like "TANF is not good enough for any family" and "We believe welfare is not the best option for your family." Applicants were rejected for missing appointments or for filing fewer than 24 job applications in a week.

Rae McCormack, one of the people living on less than $2 a day profiled by Edin and Shaefer, reported being told by a caseworker, "We don't have enough to go around for everyone. Come back next year" — even though caseloads in Ohio are very low.

"You set up a system that incentivizes welfare for states, not people," Shaefer told me. "States can keep their caseloads low and redirect the money to what they would've spent on otherwise."

This has prompted a backlash among even many conservatives. Peter Germanis, a veteran of the welfare reform battles from his time at the Heritage Foundation and the Reagan White House, has become an outspoken critic of TANF because of the perverse incentives created by the block grant.

"When it comes to the TANF legislation," he writes, "Congress got virtually every technical detail wrong. … Congress gave states too much flexibility and they have used it to create a giant slush fund."

Other conservatives have told me they agree. Lawrence Mead, a political scientist at NYU and one of the intellectual godfathers of welfare reform, still considers TANF a success but finds the Germanis critique compelling.

"There are clear-cut abuses and problems in TANF regarding its implementation," he says. "The problems are clear, and the three that stand out are the failure to allow people to apply for aid; the atrophy of the work programs; and the diversion of funds to other programs. Those were not intended in TANF, and they should be stopped. We should go back to a program that does provide aid to the needy, even if it does require work."

Robert Doar, now at the American Enterprise Institute and formerly commissioner of welfare programs for Michael Bloomberg in New York, agrees. "If you were going to tweak TANF going forward, tightening up the restrictions on the spending of TANF dollars so that states were encouraged to spend them on TANF families or TANF-like families, I'd support that," he says. But he argues that the matching-fund structure of AFDC, where states that spent more got more federal money in turn, created the opposite bad incentive, toward expanding caseloads.

Brookings's Ron Haskins, who helped draft the welfare reform legislation as a House committee staffer and is still a defender of it, nonetheless concedes that the block grant went awry, and it makes him wary of plans like House Speaker Paul Ryan's to block grant food stamps, Medicaid, and the rest of the federal safety net as well.

"The TANF experience has got to give you pause," he says. "If you give states flexibility, they're going to use it, and they're going to use it in ways you didn't anticipate."
How Democrats have turned on welfare reform, and where we go from here

These critiques of the law attracted little notice outside of academia and think tanks until the 2016 primaries. But because Bernie Sanders opposed welfare reform while Hillary Clinton claimed to have rounded up votes for it, the new skeptical consensus became a significant liability for Clinton.

Sanders himself cited the Edin/Shaefer research, saying, "Since [welfare reform] was signed into law, the number of families living in extreme poverty has more than doubled."

"The federal safety net for poor families was torn to shreds by the Clinton administration in its effort to ‘end welfare as we know it,’" Michelle Alexander wrote in her essay in the Nation "Why Hillary Clinton Does Not Deserve the Black Vote."

A recent dispute between Sanders-sympathetic Demos researcher Matt Bruenig and Clinton ally and Center for American Progress head Neera Tanden, which ended with Bruenig getting dismissed from his position, centered on his allegations that Tanden supported welfare reform.

Tellingly, Tanden did not defend welfare reform. She denied ever supporting it — just like Clinton herself declined to defend the law's record to WNYC, rather trying to explain how it failed.

"I would put most of the responsibility on the Bush administration and on governors and on the failure to be able to get some of what was tried to have more modulation when there were downturns in the economy," she said.

At the same time, the leftward Democratic Party movement on welfare reform has not led to calls to return to AFDC. The 100 percent phaseout rates, combined with sub–poverty level benefits, are not good policy. And programs that are widely hated by the public are not good long-term policy.

There's widespread consensus, including by experts on the left, that resurrecting the program is not an option. "AFDC was a deeply flawed program, and it was particularly deeply flawed because it was so disliked across the board," Shaefer says. "No one sensible is saying that we should go back to the old system," Harry Holzer adds.

So what do we do instead?

Almost everyone across the political spectrum agrees that something has likely gone wrong with the way the TANF block grant is handled. So the simplest way to address welfare reform's failures would be to try to reform TANF to function more effectively.

The Obama administration has a proposal to do just that in its latest budget, requiring that at least 55 percent of state and federal funds go to work activities, child care, and cash assistance. Obama would also create a permanent TANF fund for recessions, to help make the program better at fighting downturns, and would, for the first time ever, increase the size of the TANF block grant.

Doar has an even simpler proposal: He'd require states to examine all cases of food stamp recipients reporting no income and work to enroll them in TANF. That, he argues, would effectively tackle cases of extreme poverty.

Most left-of-center experts I spoke to, however, wanted to go further. Their answers generally involved the creation of one of two new programs for low-income Americans. The first is a child allowance. The second is a subsidized jobs program, like the one David Ellwood originally wanted as part of welfare reform.

A child allowance is a universal benefit paid out equally to all families with children. It's a very common policy across the developed world, with countries like Germany, France, Sweden, and Ireland all boasting versions. In a US context, that would provide a source of cash to families with children who lost one when AFDC went away — but because it's universal, it would likely avoid becoming as politically toxic as AFDC did.

The Center for American Progress endorses a version of this through its proposal to make the $1,000 child tax credit fully refundable and add a $125-a-month ($1,500-a-year) young child tax credit, also fully refundable. Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), along with Nancy Pelosi and Democrats’ ranking member on Ways and Means, Sander Levin, has introduced legislation creating the latter.

Wisconsin’s Timothy Smeeding, Jane Waldfogel at Columbia, Shaefer, and a number of other poverty researchers are putting together an even more ambitious proposal that would pay out $250 a month per child under 6 and $200 a month per kid ages 6 to 18.

"There's still an incentive to work," Smeeding argues. "We're talking about something that's modest and that's low. … It's not a lot of money, but it does provide a reliable steady floor."

The main argument against that plan would be that it does hurt the incentive to work. That's what's implied by Moffitt's argument that the income effect — the raw increase in income generated by welfare — was the primary reason AFDC reduced work. "You can't give people money without causing them to work less," Mead insists.

Hoynes, though slightly skeptical of a child allowance on cost grounds, disputes this. "Poor folks' income effect responses are not very large, because they're really poor, and they need the money," she argues. That suggests a child allowance wouldn't provide much of a work disincentive.

The other main category of solution involves subsidized or public-provided jobs. This was part of the original liberal image of welfare reform and responds to Americans' wariness of assisting poor people who aren't working. It got new traction in the wake of the recession, when the stimulus package authorized a TANF emergency fund that states used for subsidized job programs.

Though the program wasn’t rigorously evaluated, retrospective analyses suggested that the fund was effective at creating work at low cost: $1.3 billion in federal funding led to more than 260,000 new jobs, a ratio of about $5,000 per job created. The fact that the subsidized jobs programs were set up and implemented quickly was also encouraging, suggesting that large-scale direct job creation is administratively possible in the modern era.

The idea could get fairly wide buy-in. Brookings and AEI recently convened a bipartisan working group of 15 poverty scholars — including Ellwood, Doar, Haskins, Mead, and Waldfogel — attempting to arrive at a common approach to combating poverty. The resulting report was very enthusiastic about subsidized jobs, and particularly positive toward the TANF emergency fund.

"I actually support that in principle," Mead says. "If you want to require work, you must be sure work is available, but in principle that would have to mean some kind of job guarantee." This could be useful not just for the single mothers AFDC targeted but for underemployed men as well.

William Julius Wilson, at Harvard, is also a strong believer in subsidized jobs, suggesting former Rep. George Miller's (D-CA) 2011 Local Jobs for America Act as a worthy model.

"When I talk about public sector jobs, I mean the types of jobs provided by the Works Progress Administration [WPA] during the Great Depression," Wilson says. "Work that would help to improve the infrastructure in our communities, including state and local park districts that suffer from lack of upkeep and limited hours; cleaning playgrounds, beaches, and other recreational areas; working in public libraries to keep them open into the evening and on weekends; increasing the number of safe, stimulating day care centers for toddlers and preschoolers; improving and increasing the number of after-school programs for school-age children."

Sheldon Danziger, a leading left-of-center welfare expert who's now serving as president of the Russell Sage Foundation and who was in the Brookings-AEI group, also places heavy emphasis on subsidized work. "We don’t have enough experience with guaranteed public sector work. I would certainly experiment with that," he says. "I would also welcome public subsidies for private sector and nonprofit employers, summer jobs for youth, etc."

One thing that's clear is that any solution would cost money. The TANF Emergency Fund might've been cheap, but there's no guarantee that it would scale up at the same cost per job. Miller's bill allocated $75 billion. A child allowance paying $2,500 per year ($208 per month) would cost $109.3 billion a year on top of existing child tax credit spending.

A comprehensive plan from the Community Advocates Public Policy Institute in Wisconsin, incorporating a subsidized jobs program and expanded EITC, among other measures, would cut poverty by at least half. It'd also cost $332 billion to $399 billion per year.

To be clear, the US could afford a policy that big. Even though $400 billion a year sounds like a lot, it is a little over 2 percent of GDP; the US could grow its government by that amount and still remain way smaller than European welfare states, cutting poverty dramatically. The question is whether, in an era of divided government where the Republican Party has a strong ideological commitment to lower spending, a governing coalition will ever be willing to make that large a commitment to fighting poverty.
Watch: We know how to end poverty. So why don't we?

The Relation of Violent Video Games to Adolescent Aggression: An Examination of Moderated Mediation Effect
For authors
43-55 minutes
Introduction
Violent Video Games and Aggression

The relationship between violent video games and adolescent aggression has become a hot issue in psychological research (Wiegman and Schie, 1998; Anderson and Bushman, 2001; Anderson et al., 2010; Ferguson et al., 2012; Greitemeyer, 2014; Yang et al., 2014; Boxer et al., 2015). Based on the General Aggression Model (GAM), Anderson et al. suggested that violent video games constitute an antecedent variable of aggressive behavior, i.e., the degree of exposure to violent video games directly leads to an increase of aggression (Anderson and Bushman, 2001; Bushman and Anderson, 2002; Anderson, 2004; Anderson et al., 2004). Related longitudinal studies (Anderson et al., 2008), meta-analyses (Anderson et al., 2010; Greitemeyer and Mugge, 2014), event-related potential studies (Bailey et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2015), and trials about juvenile delinquents (DeLisi et al., 2013) showed that exposure to violent video games significantly predicts adolescent aggression.

Although Anderson et al. insisted on using the GAM to explain the effect of violent video games on aggression, other researchers have proposed alternative points of view. For example, a meta-analysis by Sherry (2001) suggested that violent video games have minor influence on adolescent aggression. Meanwhile, Ferguson (2007) proposed that publication bias (or file drawer effect) may have implications in the effect of violent video games on adolescent aggression. Publication bias means that compared with articles with negative results, those presenting positive results (such as statistical significance) are more likely to be published (Rosenthal and Rosnow, 1991). A meta-analysis by Ferguson (2007) found that after publication bias adjustment, the related studies cannot support the hypothesis that violent video games are highly correlated with aggression. Then, Ferguson et al. proposed a Catalyst Model (CM), which is opposite to the GAM. According to this model, genetic predisposition can lead to an aggressive child temperament and aggressive adult personality. Individuals who have an aggressive temperament or an aggressive personality are more likely to produce violent behavior during times of environmental strain. Environmental factors act as catalysts for violent acts for an individual who have a violence-prone personality. This means that although the environment does not cause violent behavior, but it can moderate the causal influence of biology on violence. The CM model suggested that exposure to violent video games is not an antecedent variable of aggressive behavior, but only acts as a catalyst influencing its form (Ferguson et al., 2008). Much of studies (Ferguson et al., 2009, 2012; Ferguson, 2013, 2015; Furuya-Kanamori and Doi, 2016; Huesmann et al., 2017) found that adolescent aggression cannot be predicted by the exposure to violent video games, but it is closely related to antisocial personality traits, peer influence, and family violence.

Anderson and his collaborators (Groves et al., 2014; Kepes et al., 2017) suggested there were major methodological shortcomings in the studies of Ferguson et al. and redeclared the validity of their own researches. Some researchers supported Anderson et al. and criticized Ferguson’s view (Gentile, 2015; Rothstein and Bushman, 2015). However, Markey (2015) held a neutral position that extreme views should not be taken in the relationship between violent video games and aggression.

In fact, the relation of violent video games to aggression is complicated. Besides the controversy between the above two models about whether there is an influence, other studies explored the role of internal factors such as normative belief about aggression and external factors such as family environment in the relationship between violent video games and aggression.
Normative Beliefs About Aggression, Violence Video Games, and Aggression

Normative beliefs about aggression are one of the most important cognitive factors influencing adolescent aggression; they refer to an assessment of aggression acceptability by an individual (Huesmann and Guerra, 1997). They can be divided into two types: general beliefs and retaliatory beliefs. The former means a general view about aggression, while the latter reflects aggressive beliefs in provocative situations. Normative beliefs about aggression reflect the degree acceptance of aggression, which affects the choice of aggressive behavior.

Studies found that normative beliefs about aggression are directly related to aggression. First, self-reported aggression is significantly correlated to normative beliefs about aggression (Bailey and Ostrov, 2008; Li et al., 2015). General normative beliefs about aggression can predict young people’s physical, verbal, and indirect aggression (Lim and Ang, 2009); retaliatory normative beliefs about aggression can anticipate adolescent retaliation behavior after 1 year (Werner and Hill, 2010; Krahe and Busching, 2014). There is a longitudinal temporal association of normative beliefs about aggression with aggression (Krahe and Busching, 2014). Normative beliefs about aggression are significantly positively related to online aggressive behavior (Wright and Li, 2013), which is the most important determining factor of adolescent cyberbullying (Kowalski et al., 2014). Teenagers with high normative beliefs about aggression are more likely to become bullies and victims of traditional bullying and cyberbullying (Burton et al., 2013). Finally, normative beliefs about aggression can significantly predict the support and reinforcement of bystanders in offline bullying and cyberbullying (Machackova and Pfetsch, 2016).

According to Bandura’s social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1989), violent video games can initiate adolescents’ observational learning. In this situation, not only can they imitate the aggressive behavior of the model but also their understanding and acceptability about aggression may change. Therefore, normative beliefs about aggression can also be a mediator between violent video games and adolescent aggression (Duan et al., 2014; Anderson et al., 2017; Huesmann et al., 2017). Studies have shown that the mediating role of normative beliefs about aggression is not influenced by factors such as gender, prior aggression, and parental monitoring (Gentile et al., 2014).
Family Environment, Violence Video Games, and Aggression

Family violence, parenting style, and other family factors have major effects on adolescent aggression. On the one hand, family environment can influence directly on aggression by shaping adolescents’ cognition and setting up behavioral models. Many studies have found that family violence and other negative factors are positively related to adolescent aggression (Ferguson et al., 2009, 2012; Ferguson, 2013), while active family environment can reduce the aggressive behavior (Batanova and Loukas, 2014).

On the other hand, family environment can act on adolescent aggression together with other factors, such as exposure to violent video games. Analysis of the interaction between family conflict and media violence (including violence on TV and in video games) to adolescent aggression showed that teenagers living in higher conflict families with more media violence exposure show more aggressive behavior (Fikkers et al., 2013). Parental monitoring is significantly correlated with reduced media violence exposure and a reduction in aggressive behavior 6 months later (Gentile et al., 2014). Parental mediation can moderate the relationship between media violence exposure and normative beliefs about aggression, i.e., for children with less parental mediation, predictability of violent media exposure on normative beliefs about aggression is stronger (Linder and Werner, 2012). Parental mediation is closely linked to decreased aggression caused by violent media (Nathanson, 1999; Rasmussen, 2014; Padilla-Walker et al., 2016). Further studies have shown that the autonomy-supportive restrictive mediation of parents is related to a reduction in current aggressive behavior by decreasing media violence exposure; conversely, inconsistent restrictive mediation is associated with an increase of current aggressive behavior by enhancing media violence exposure (Fikkers et al., 2017).
The Current Study

Despite GAM and CM hold opposite views on the relationship between violent video games and aggression, both of the two models imply the same idea that aggression cannot be separated from internal and external factors. While emphasizing on negative effects of violent video games on adolescents’ behavior, the GAM uses internal factors to explain the influencing mechanism, including aggressive beliefs, aggressive behavior scripts, and aggressive personality (Bushman and Anderson, 2002; Anderson and Carnagey, 2014). Although the CM considers that there is no significant relation between violent video games and aggression, it also acknowledges the role of external factors such as violent video games and family violence. Thus, these two models seem to be contradictory, but in fact, they reveal the mechanism of aggression from different points of view. It will be more helpful to explore the effect of violent video games on aggression from the perspective of combination of internal and external factors.

Although previous studies have investigated the roles of normative beliefs about aggression and family factors in the relationship between violent video games and adolescent aggression separately, the combined effect of these two factors remains unstudied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the combined effect of normative beliefs about aggression and family environment. This can not only confirm the effects of violent video games on adolescent aggression further but also can clarify the influencing mechanism from the integration of GAM and CM to a certain extent. Based on the above, the following three hypotheses were proposed:

Hypothesis 1: There is a significant positive correlation between exposure to violent video games and adolescent aggression.

Hypothesis 2: Normative beliefs about aggression are the mediator of exposure to violent video games and adolescent aggression.

Hypothesis 3: The family environment can moderate the mediation effects of normative beliefs about aggression in exposure to violent video games and adolescent aggression; exposure to violent video games, family environment, normative beliefs about aggression, and aggression constitute a moderated mediation model.
Materials and Methods
Participants

All subjects gave informed written consent for participation in this investigation, and their parents signed parental written informed consent. The study was reviewed and approved by the Professor Committee of School of Psychology, Nanjing Normal University, which is the committee responsible for providing ethics approvals. A total of 648 Chinese middle school students participated in this study, including 339 boys and 309 girls; 419 students were from cities and towns, and 229 from the countryside. There were 277 and 371 junior and high school students, respectively. Ages ranged from 12 to 19 years, averaging 14.73 (SD = 1.60).
Measures
Video Game Questionnaire (VGQ)

The Video Game Questionnaire (Anderson and Dill, 2000) required participants to list their favorite five video games and assess their use frequencies, the degree of violent content, and the degree of violent images on a 7-point scale (1, participants seldom play video games, with no violent content or image; 7, participants often play video games with many violent contents and images). Methods for calculating the score of exposure to violent video games: (score of violent content in the game + score of violent images in the game) × use frequency/5. Chen et al. (2012) found that the Chinese version of this questionnaire had high internal consistency reliability and good content validity. The Chinese version was used in this study, and the Cronbach’s α coefficient of the questionnaire was 0.88.
Aggression Questionnaire (AQ)

There were 29 items in AQ (Buss and Perry, 1992), including four dimensions: physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger, and hostility. The scale used 5-point scoring criteria (1, very incongruent with my features; 5, very congruent with my features). Scores for each item were added to obtain the dimension score, and dimension scores were summed to obtain the total score. The Chinese version of AQ had good internal consistency reliability and construct validity (Ying and Dai, 2008). In this study, the Chinese version was used and its Cronbach’s α coefficient was 0.83.
Family Environment Scale (FES)

The FES (Moos, 1990) includes 90 true-false questions and is divided into 10 subscales, including cohesion, expressiveness, conflict, independence, achievement-orientation, intellectual-cultural orientation, active-recreational orientation, moral-religious emphasis, organization, and control. The Chinese version of FES was revised by Fei et al. (1991) and used in this study. Three subscales closely related to aggression were selected, including cohesion, conflict, and moral-religious emphasis, with 27 items in total. The family environment score was the sum of scores of these three subscales (the conflict subscale was first inverted). The Cronbach’s α coefficient of the questionnaire was 0.75.
Normative Beliefs About Aggression Scale (NOBAGS)

There are 20 items in the NOBAGS (Huesmann and Guerra, 1997), which includes retaliation (12 items) and general (8 items) aggression belief. A 4-point Likert scale is used (1, absolutely wrong; 4, absolutely right). The subjects were asked to assess the accuracy of the behavior described in each item. High score means high level of normative beliefs about aggression. The revised Chinese version of NOBAGS consists of two factors: retaliation (nine items) and general (six items) aggression belief. Its internal consistency coefficient and test-retest reliability are 0.81 and 0.79. Confirmative factor analysis showed that this version has good construct validity: χ2 = 280.09, df = 89, χ2/df = 3.15, RMSEA = 0.07, SRMR = 0.04, NFI = 0.95, NNFI = 0.96, and CFI = 0.96 (Shao and Wang, 2017). In this study, the Cronbach’s α coefficient of the Chinese version was 0.88.
Procedures

Group testing was performed in randomly selected classes of six middle schools. All subjects completed the above four questionnaires.
Data Analysis

IBM SPSS Statistics 22 was used to analysis the correlations among study variables, the mediating effect of normative beliefs about aggression on the relationship between exposure to violent video games and aggression, and the moderating role of family environment in the relationship between exposure to violent video games and normative beliefs about aggression. In order to validate the moderated mediation model, Mplus 7 was also used.
Results
Correlation Analysis Among Study Variables

In this study, self-reported questionnaires were used to collect data, and results might be influenced by common method bias. Therefore, the Harman’s single-factor test was used to assess common method bias before data analysis. The results showed that eigenvalues of 34 unrotated factors were greater than 1, and the amount of variation explained by the first factor was 10.01%, which is much less than 40% of the critical value. Accordingly, common method bias was not significant in this study.

As described in Table 1, the degree of exposure to violent video games showed significant positive correlations to normative beliefs about aggression and aggression; family environment was negatively correlated to normative beliefs about aggression and aggression; normative beliefs about aggression were significantly and positively related to aggression. The gender difference of exposure to violent video games (t = 7.93, p < 0.001) and normative beliefs about aggression (t = 2.74, p < 0.01) were significant, which boys scored significantly higher than girls.

Mediating Effect Analysis

To examine the mediation effect of normative beliefs about aggression on the relationship between exposure to violent video games and aggression, gender factor was controlled firstly. Stepwise regression analysis showed that the regression of aggression to violent video games (c = 0.28, t = 6.96, p < 0.001), the regression of normative beliefs about aggression to violent video games (a = 0.19, t = 4.69, p < 0.001), and the regression of aggression to violent video games (c′ = 0.22, t = 5.69, p < 0.001) and normative beliefs about aggression (b = 0.31, t = 8.25, p < 0.001) were all significant. Thus, normative beliefs about aggression played a partial mediating role in exposure to violent video games and aggression. The mediation effect value was 0.06, accounting for 21.43% (0.06/0.28) of the total effect.
Moderated Mediation Effect Analysis

After standardizing scores of exposure to violent videogames, normative beliefs about aggression, family environment, and aggression, two interaction terms were calculated, including family environment × exposure to violent video games and family environment × normative beliefs about aggression. Regression analysis was carried out after controlling gender factor (Table 2).

www.frontiersin.org

Table 2. Moderated mediation effect analysis of the relationship between violent video exposure and aggression.

In the first step, a simple moderated model (Model 1) between exposure to violent video games and aggression was established. The result showed that exposure to violent video games had a significant effect on aggression (c 1 = 0.24, t = 6.13, p < 0.001), while the effect of family environment × exposure to violent video games on aggression was not significant (c 3 = 0.05, t = −1.31, p = 0.19), indicating that the relationship between exposure to violent video games and aggression was not moderated by family environment.

Next, a moderated model (Model 2) between exposure to violent video games and normative beliefs about aggression was established. The results showed that exposure to violent video games had a significant effect on normative beliefs about aggression (a 1 = 0.13, t = 3.42, p < 0.001), and the effect of family environment × exposure to violent video games on normative beliefs about aggression was significant (a 3 = −0.13, t = −3.63, p < 0.01).

In the third step, a moderated mediation model (Model 3) between exposure to violent video games and aggression was established. As shown in Table 2, the effect of normative beliefs about aggression on aggression was significant (b 1 = 0.24, t = 6.15, p < 0.001), and the effect of family environment × exposure to violent video games on normative beliefs about aggression was not significant (b 2 = 0.02, t = 0.40, p = 0.69). Because both a 3 and b 1 were significant, exposure to violent video games, family environment, normative beliefs about aggression, and aggression constituted a moderated mediation model. Normative beliefs about aggression played a mediating role between exposure to violent video games and aggression, while family environment was a moderator between exposure to violent video games and normative beliefs about aggression. Mplus analysis proved that the moderated mediation model had good model fitting (χ2/df = 1.54, CFI = 0.99, TLI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.03, and SRMR = 0.01).

To further analyze the moderating effect of the family environment and exposure to violent video games on normative beliefs about aggression, the family environment was divided into the high and low groups, according to the principle of standard deviation, and a simple slope test was performed (Figure 1). The results found that for individuals with high score of family environment, prediction of exposure to violent video games to normative beliefs about aggression was not significant (b = 0.08, SE = 0.08, p = 0.37). For individuals with low score of family environment, exposure to violent video games could significantly predict normative beliefs about aggression (b = 0.34, SE = 0.09, p < 0.001). Based on the overall findings, individuals with high scores of family environment showed a nonsignificant mediating effect of normative beliefs about aggression on the relation of exposure to violent video games and aggression; however, for individuals with low scores of family environment, normative beliefs about aggression played a partial mediating role in the effect of exposure to violent video games on aggression.

Discussion
Main Findings and Implications

This study found a significantly positive correlation between exposure to violent video games and adolescent aggression, corroborating existing studies (Anderson, 2004; Anderson et al., 2010; DeLisi et al., 2013; Greitemeyer and Mugge, 2014). Anderson et al. (2017) assessed teenagers in Australia, China, Germany, the United States, and other three countries and found that exposure to violent media, including television, movies, and video games, is positively related to adolescent aggression, demonstrating cross-cultural consistency; 8% of variance in aggression could be independently explained by exposure to violent media. In this study, after controlling for gender and family environment, R 2 for exposure to violent video games in predicting adolescent aggression was 0.05, indicating that 5% of variation in adolescent aggression could be explained by exposure to violent media. These consistent findings confirm the effect of exposure to violent video games on adolescent aggression and can be explained by the GAM. According to the GAM (Bushman and Anderson, 2002; Anderson and Carnagey, 2014), violent video games can make teenagers acquire, repeat, and reinforce aggression-related knowledge structures, including aggressive beliefs and attitude, aggressive perceptual schemata, aggressive expectation schemata, aggressive behavior scripts, and aggression desensitization. Therefore, aggressive personality is promoted, increasing the possibility of aggressive behavior. The Hypothesis 1 of this study was validated and provided evidence for the GAM.

As shown above, normative beliefs about aggression had a partial mediation effect on the relationship between exposure to violent video games and aggression. Exposure to violent video games, on the one hand, can predict adolescent aggression directly; on the other hand, it had an indirect effect on adolescent aggression via normative beliefs about aggression. According to the above results, when exposure to violent video games changes by 1 standard deviation, adolescent aggression varies by 0.28 standard deviation, with 0.22 standard deviation being a direct effect of exposure to violent video games on adolescent aggression and 0.06 standard deviation representing the effect through normative beliefs about aggression. Too much violence in video games makes it easy for individuals to become accustomed to violence and emotionally apathetic towards the harmful consequences of violence. Moreover, it can make individuals accept the idea that violence is a good way of problem solving, leading to an increase in normative beliefs about aggression; under certain situational cues, it is more likely to become violent or aggressive. This conclusion is supported by other studies (Gentile et al., 2014; Anderson et al., 2017; Huesmann et al., 2017). Like Hypothesis 1, Hypothesis 2 was validated the GAM.

One of the main findings of this study was the validation of Hypothesis 3: a moderated mediation model was constructed involving exposure to violent video games, family environment, normative beliefs about aggression, and aggression. Family environment moderated the first half of the mediation process of violent video games, normative beliefs about aggression, and aggression. In this study, family environment encompassed three factors, including (1) cohesion reflecting the degree of mutual commitment, assistance, and support among family members; (2) conflict reflecting the extent of anger, aggression, and conflict among family members; and (3) moral-religious emphasis reflecting the degree of emphasis on ethics, religion, and values. Individuals with high scores of family environment often help each other; seldom show anger, attack, and contradiction openly; and pay more attention to morality and values. These positive aspects would help them understand violence in video games from the right perspective, reduce recognition and acceptance of violence or aggression, and diminish the effect of violent video games on normative beliefs about aggression. Hence, exposure to violent video games could not predict normative beliefs about aggression of these individuals. By contrast, individuals with low scores of family environment are less likely to help each other; they often openly show anger, attack, and contradiction and do not pay much attention to morality and values. These negative aspects would not decrease but increase their acceptance of violence and aggression. For these individuals, because of the lack of mitigation mechanisms, exposure to violent video games could predict normative beliefs about aggression significantly.

The moderated mediation model of the relationship between exposure to violent video games and aggression could not only help reveal that exposure to violent video games can affect aggression but also provide an elaboration of the influencing mechanism. According to this model, for individuals with high scores of family environment, exposure to violent video games had only direct effect on aggression. However, for those with low scores of family environment, there was not only a direct effect of exposure to violent video games on aggression but also an indirect effect mediated by normative beliefs about aggression. In short, exposure to violence video games affecting aggression through normative beliefs about aggression is more likely to happen to adolescents with poor family environment than those with good family environment. That is, generation of adolescent aggression is not only related to internal cognitive factors but also to external situations. As Piotrowski and Valkenburg (Piotrowski and Valkenburg, 2015; Valkenburg, 2015) pointed out, the effect of violent video games/media on adolescents is a complex interaction of dispositional, developmental, and social factors, and individual differences in susceptibility to these three factors determine the nature and the extent of this influence. The proposed model incorporated some perspectives of GAM and CM: while confirming the effect of exposure to violent video games on aggression occurrence, the combined effect of individual and environmental factors was verified.

Compared with the simple mediation or moderation model, the present moderated mediation model provided deeper insights into the internal mechanism of the effect of violent video games on aggression, providing inspirations for preventing adolescent aggression. First, in view of the close relationship between exposure to violent video games and adolescent aggression, relevant government departments should continue to improve the grading system of video games; meanwhile, parents should appropriately monitor the types of video games used by teenagers as well as the time spent and reduce the degree of exposure to violent video games. Second, by allowing teenagers to objectively distinguish between violence in games and reality, the mediating role of normative beliefs about aggression could inspire people to identify rational ways to solve violence problems and to experience the hurtful consequences of aggression. This would help adolescents change normative beliefs about aggression, establish a correct view of right and wrong, and reduce the occurrence of aggression. Finally, the moderating effect of family environment on the mediation process suggests that more attention should be paid to the important role of family environment. On the one hand, family education is closely related to adolescent aggression. Then, parents should create a good family atmosphere, publicly show anger and aggression as little as possible, and advocate and practice positive moral values. Parents should adopt authoritative styles, abandoning autocratic and indulgent parenting styles (Casas et al., 2006; Sandstrom, 2007; Underwood et al., 2009; Kawabata et al., 2011) to minimize the negative effect of exposure to violent video games. On the other hand, for teenagers with poor family environment, while reducing exposure to violent video games, it is particularly important to change their normative beliefs about aggression, no longer viewing aggression as an alternative way to solve problems.
Limitations

Limitations of the current study should be mentioned. First, only Chinese school students were assessed, in a relatively small number, which could affect sample representativeness. A large sample of teenagers from different countries and in different ages, also including juvenile offenders, would be more accurate in revealing the effect of violent video games on adolescent aggression. Second, this study only focused on violent video games, not involving violent media such as internet and television, daily life events, wars, and other major social events. Indeed, these factors also have important effects on adolescent aggression, and their influencing mechanisms and combined effect are worth investigating further. Third, this study mainly adopted the self-report method. Use of peer, parent, or teacher reports to assess exposure to violent video games and aggression would help improve the effectiveness of the study. Fourth, there might be other mediators, moderating variables and relational models. In addition to normative beliefs about aggression and family environment, individual emotions, personality characteristics, school climate, and companions may play mediating or moderating roles in the relationship between violent video games and aggression. This study developed a moderated mediation model between family environment and normative beliefs about aggression, but the possibility of multiple mediation and mediated moderation models cannot be ruled out.
Conclusion

The current study showed that exposure to violent video games is positively related to adolescent aggression; normative beliefs about aggression have a mediating effect on exposure to violent video games and adolescent aggression, while the family environment regulates the first part of the mediation process. For individuals with good family environment, exposure to violent video games only has a direct effect on aggression; however, for those with poor family environment, there is an indirect effect mediated by normative beliefs about aggression alongside a direct effect. This moderated mediation model incorporates some perspectives of GAM and CM, enriching studies of generative mechanism of adolescent aggression.

The file drawer effect: A call for meticulous methodology and tolerance for non-significant results
Priscilla Joys Nagarajan, Bharath Kumar Garla, M Taranath, and I Nagarajan1
5-7 minutes

Sir,

The Indian Journal of Anaesthesia should be complimented for publication of a separate issue dedicated to research methodology, covering meticulously and comprehensively all the aspects of research methodology.[1]

Evidence-based medicine is the golden bridge that connects the research world and the clinical domain. Systematic reviews are hailed as the foundation of this approach. They track down the best ‘available’ research in a particular area of interest, and systematically review them to generate a body of evidence that enables clinicians to adopt them into their daily practice. The important word in this statement is ‘available’ research.

Evidence suggests that there is a humongous score of researches which have been conducted but not reported or published for various reasons. It should be plausible to our minds that any evidence built on only a few available studies excluding this enormous unpublished treasure should be found wanting for the validity and relevance of the extrapolated results.[2] This brings to the fore, the debate of ‘The File Drawer Effect’ which refers to the practice of tucking away negative/neutral/statistically non-significant research findings into ‘file drawers’ making these results inaccessible and hidden from reviewers.[3] It is speculated that every significant result in the published world has 19 non-significant counterparts in file drawers.[4]

Failure to report all the findings of a clinical trial breaks the core value of honesty, trustworthiness and integrity of the researchers. A research with potential implications for a wider society lays wasted.[5] One of the main reasons cited for this situation is the bias exhibited towards positive and statistically significant results by the scientific community. There exists an innate complexity in the nature of human beings to question and challenge any new ideas that differ from pre-existing beliefs.[6] Negative results tend to be equated to erroneous and flawed study designs. Researches show that studies with positive results enjoy two and a half times more chances of being published than those with negative results.[2] Studies point out that researches with negative results take longer time to appear in print, and attract poor citations yielding lesser overall impact.[2]

This deprives the scientific community of valuable evidence, which if made available might significantly affect the direction of the evidence. The classical example of the public scandal involving the drug paroxetine in the year 2004 exemplifies how the hopeful impressions created by published data could be negated when unpublished studies were unearthed and analysed.[2]

When a research with negative results goes unreported, a lot of money, material and manpower are spent elsewhere trying to repeat the same research. Incomplete reporting can lead to overestimation of benefits or the underestimation of risks of the intervention.[2] Such fallacies can be overcome by being transparent in the reporting by following appropriate reporting checklists.[5]

Publication of any research is ethically imperative. The World Health Organization in its statement on public disclosure of clinical trial results has called for the reporting of all clinical trials, including the past unreported trials, and for the data to be made available in searchable clinical trial registries. It has also stated that it is desirable to publish the research in a peer-reviewed journal.[7] Although there are several journals completely devoted to publication of studies with negative results, peer-reviewed journals must explicitly consider the publication of research with good scientific rigour, regardless of the nature of the results.[8] There is a huge need to revamp the minds of the researchers towards negative/null results. It is vital to inculcate a positive attitude towards negative results and understand that they are equally important.

New Study Shows That There Is No Link Between Violent Video Games And Aggression In Teenagers
Ollie Barder
3 minutes
It's been shown yet again that playing violent video games do not make people more aggressive.

In yet another study on the subject, it shows that there is no link between playing violent video games and aggression in adolescents.

Courtesy of the Oxford Internet Institute and the University of Oxford, this new study was published in Royal Society Open Science and is being touted as being one of the most comprehensive studies on the subject to date.

That is because this study used a combination of subjective and objective data to measure teen aggression and violence in games. Compared to previous research on the subject, which relied on self-reported data from teenagers, this study used information from parents and carers to judge the level of aggressive behavior in their children.

What’s more, the content of the video games was classified using the official PEGI and ESRB rating systems, rather than just the player’s perceptions of the amount of violence in the game.

If you're curious about the sampling here, as you should be, then it comprised of British 14 to 15-year olds and an equal number of parents or carers, totaling 2,008 subjects in all.

The result of this thorough approach showed that there was no link between violent video games and teenage aggression, something that the lead researcher Professor Andrew Przybylski went on to clarify.

    The idea that violent video games drive real-world aggression is a popular one, but it hasn’t tested very well over time. Despite interest in the topic by parents and policy-makers, the research has not demonstrated that there is cause for concern.

As Przybylski points out, this is not the first study to show these kinds of results and it is getting to the point now, that blaming video games for outbursts of teenage related aggression holds no weight. However, he did admit that trash talking online and other such behavior warranted further study.

Not to mention we have all the counter studies that actually show that playing video games has clear cognitive benefits, so it really is about time that video games were no longer demonized as the cause for all of society’s woes and accepted for what they are.

Resolution on Violent Video Games
15-19 minutes

Adopted by the APA Council of Representatives in August 2015. (Suggested citation is included with references.)

Video game use has become pervasive in the American child's life: More than 90% of U.S. children play some kind of video games; when considering only adolescents ages 12 - 17, that figure rises to 97% (Lenhart et.al, 2008; NPD Group, 2011;). Although high levels of video game use are often popularly associated with adolescence, children younger than age 8 who play video games spend a daily average of 69 minutes on handheld console games, 57 minutes on computer games, and 45 minutes on mobile games, including tablets (Rideout, 2013). Considering the vast number of children and youth who use video games and that more than 85% of video games on the market contain some form of violence, the public has understandably been concerned about the effects that using violent video games may have on individuals, especially children and adolescents.

News commentators often turn to violent video game use as a potential causal contributor to acts of mass homicide. The media point to perpetrators' gaming habits as either a reason that they have chosen to commit their crimes, or as a method of training. This practice extends at least as far back as the Columbine massacre (1999) and has more recently figured prominently in the investigation into and reporting of the Aurora, CO theatre shootings (2012), Sandy Hook massacre (2012), and Washington Navy Yard massacre (2013). This coverage has contributed to significant public discussion of the impacts of violent video game use. As a consequence of this popular perception, several efforts have been made to limit children's consumption of violent video games, to better educate parents about the effects of the content to which their children are being exposed, or both. Several jurisdictions have attempted to enact laws limiting the sale of violent video games to minors, and in 2011 the US Supreme Court considered the issue in Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association, concluding that the First Amendment fully protects violent speech, even for minors.

In keeping with the American Psychological Association's (APA) mission to advance the development, communication, and application of psychological knowledge to benefit society, the Task Force on Violent Media was formed to review the APA Resolution on Violence in Video Games and Interactive Media adopted in 2005 and the related literature in order to ensure that the APA's resolution on the topic continues to be informed by the best science currently available and that it accurately represents the research findings directly related to the topic. This Resolution is based on the Task Force's review and is an update of the 2005 Resolution.

Scientists have investigated the effects of violent video game use for more than two decades. Multiple meta-analyses of the research have been conducted. Quantitative reviews since APA's 2005 Resolution that have focused on the effects of violent video game use have found a direct association between violent video game use and aggressive outcomes (Anderson et al. 2010, Ferguson 2007a, Ferguson 2007b, Ferguson & Kilburn 2009). Although the effect sizes reported are all similar (0.19, 0.15, 0.08, and 0.16, respectively), the interpretations of these effects have varied dramatically, contributing to the public debate about the effects of violent video games.

The link between violent video game exposure and aggressive behavior is one of the most studied and best established. Since the earlier meta-analyses, this link continues to be a reliable finding and shows good multi-method consistency across various representations of both violent video game exposure and aggressive behavior (e.g., Moller & Krahe, 2009; Saleem, Anderson, & Gentile, 2012). Aggressive behavior examined in this research included experimental proxy paradigms, such as the administration of a noise blast to a confederate, and self-report questionnaires, peer nominations and teacher ratings of aggressiveness focused on behaviors including insults, threats, hitting, pushing, hair pulling, biting and other forms of verbal and physical aggression. The findings have also been seen over a range of samples, including those with older children, adolescent, and young adult participants. There is also consistency over time, in that the new findings are similar in effect size to those from past meta-analyses.

Similarly, the research conducted since the 2005 APA Resolution using aggressive cognitions and aggressive affect as outcomes also shows a direct effect of violent video game use (e. g., Hasan, Begue, Scharkow & Bushman, 2013; Shafer, 2012). Researchers have also continued to find that violent video game use is associated with decreases in socially desirable behavior such as prosocial behavior, empathy, and moral engagement (e.g., Arriaga, Monteiro & Esteves, 2011; Happ, Melzer & Steffgen, 2013).

The violent video game literature uses a variety of terms and definitions in considering aggression and aggressive outcomes, sometimes using "violence" and "aggression" interchangeably, or using "aggression" to represent the full range of aggressive outcomes studied, including multiple types and severity levels of associated behavior, cognitions, emotions, and neural processes. This breadth of coverage but lack of precision in terminology has contributed to some debate about the effects of violent video game use. In part, the numerous ways that violence and aggression have been considered stem from the multidisciplinary nature of the field. Epidemiologists, criminologists, physicians and others approach the phenomena of aggression and violence from different perspectives than do psychologists, and emphasize different definitions of the phenomena accordingly. Some disciplines are interested only in violence, and not other dimensions of aggression. In psychological research, aggression is usually conceptualized as behavior that is intended to harm another (see Baron & Richardson, 1994; Coie & Dodge, 1998; Huesmann & Taylor, 2006; VandenBos, 2007). Violence can be defined as an extreme form of aggression (see Encyclopedia of Psychology, 2000) or the intentional use of physical force or power, that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in harm (Krug, Dahlberg, Mercy, Zwi, & Lozano,2002 ).

Thus, all violence, including lethal violence, is aggression, but not all aggression is violence. This distinction is important for understanding this research literature, which has not focused on lethal violence as an outcome. Insufficient research has examined whether violent video game use causes lethal violence. The distinction is also important for considering the implications of the research and for interpreting popular press accounts of the research and its applicability to societal events.
Resolution

Consistent with the American Psychological Association's mission to advance the development, communication and application of psychological knowledge to benefit society and improve people's lives, this Resolution on Violent Video Games finds:

WHEREAS scientific research has demonstrated an association between violent video game use and both increases in aggressive behavior, aggressive affect, aggressive cognitions and decreases in prosocial behavior, empathy, and moral engagement;

WHEREAS there is convergence of research findings across multiple methods and multiple samples with multiple types of measurements demonstrating the association between violent video game use and both increases in aggressive behavior, aggressive affect, aggressive cognitions and decreases in prosocial behavior, empathy, and moral engagement;

WHEREAS all existing quantitative reviews of the violent video game literature have found a direct association between violent video game use and aggressive outcomes;

WHEREAS this body of research, including laboratory experiments that examine effects over short time spans following experimental manipulations and observational longitudinal studies lasting more than 2 years, has demonstrated that these effects persist over at least some time spans;

WHEREAS research suggests that the relation between violent video game use and increased aggressive outcomes remains after considering other known risk factors associated with aggressive outcomes;

WHEREAS although the number of studies directly examining the association between the amount of violent video game use and amount of change in adverse outcomes is still limited, existing research suggests that higher amounts of exposure are associated with higher levels of aggression and other adverse outcomes;

WHEREAS research demonstrates these effects for children older than 10 years, adolescents, and young adults, but very little research has included children younger than 10 years;

WHEREAS research has not adequately examined whether the association between violent video game use and aggressive outcomes differs for males and females;

WHEREAS research has not adequately included samples representative of the current population demographics;

WHEREAS research has not sufficiently examined the potential moderator effects of ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or culture;

WHEREAS many factors are known to be risk factors for increased aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition and aggressive affect, and reduced prosocial behavior, empathy and moral engagement, and violent video game use is one such risk factor;

Therefore,

BE IT RESOLVED that the American Psychological Association (APA) engage in public education and awareness activities disseminating these findings to children, parents, teachers, judges and other professionals working with children in schools and communities;

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that APA support funding of basic and intervention research by the federal government and philanthropic organizations to address the following gaps in knowledge about the effects of violent video game use:

    The association between violent video game use and negative outcomes for understudied ethnic and sociocultural populations who may be at increased risk for negative outcomes because of increased violent video game exposure or the presence of other risk factors for aggressive outcomes;
    The nature of the association between violent video game use and negative outcomes for males and females separately;
    The association between violent video game use and negative outcomes for school age and preschool age children;
    The relation between degree of exposure to violent video games and negative outcomes;
    The persistence of negative outcomes over time;
    The relation between game ratings and types, amounts, and degrees of violence present in violent video games;
    The relation between negative outcomes and game characteristics such as properties of the game, including type and degree of violence, how the game is played, and how the game is perceived by the player;
    The intersection of variables related to negative outcomes of violent video game use and the broader context of violence within the games, including choices about targets of violence, game themes, and the development and marketing of games;
    The impact of rapidly changing game technology and formats on users' experience and outcomes;
    The role of competition and cooperation in the association between violent video game use and negative outcomes; and
    The role of media literacy in mediating negative effects associated with violent video game use;

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that APA endorses the development and implementation of rigorously tested interventions that educate children, youth and families about the effects of violent video game use; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that APA strongly encourages the Entertainment Software Rating Board to refine the ESRB rating system specifically to reflect the levels and characteristics of violence in games in addition to the current global ratings.

Violent Video Games: Myths, Facts, and Unanswered Questions
14-18 minutes

After 40+ years of research, one might think that debate about media violence effects would be over. An historical examination of the research reveals that debate concerning whether such exposure is a significant risk factor for aggressive and violent behavior should have been over years ago (Bushman & Anderson, 2001). Four types of media violence studies provide converging evidence of such effects: laboratory experiments, field experiments, cross-sectional correlation studies, and longitudinal studies (Anderson & Bushman, 2002a; Bushman & Huesmann, 2000). But the development of a new genre-electronic video games-reinvigorated the debate.

Two features of video games fuel renewed interest by researchers, public policy makers, and the general public. First, the active role required by video games is a double-edged sword. It helps educational video games be excellent teaching tools for motivational and learning process reasons. But, it also may make violent video games even more hazardous than violent television or cinema. Second, the arrival of a new generation of ultraviolent video games beginning in the early 1990s and continuing unabated to the present resulted in large numbers of children and youths actively participating in entertainment violence that went way beyond anything available to them on television or in movies. Recent video games reward players for killing innocent bystanders, police, and prostitutes, using a wide range of weapons including guns, knives, flame throwers, swords, baseball bats, cars, hands, and feet. Some include cut scenes (i.e., brief movie clips supposedly designed to move the story forward) of strippers. In some, the player assumes the role of hero, whereas in others the player is a criminal.

The new debate frequently generates more heat than light. Many criticisms are simply recycled myths from earlier media violence debates, myths that have been repeatedly debunked on theoretical and empirical grounds. Valid weaknesses have also been identified (and often corrected) by media violence researchers themselves. Although the violent video game literature is still relatively new and small, we have learned a lot about their effects and have successfully answered several key questions. So, what is myth and what do we know?

Myths and Facts

Myth 1. Violent video game research has yielded very mixed results.
Facts: Some studies have yielded nonsignificant video game effects, just as some smoking studies failed to find a significant link to lung cancer. But when one combines all relevant empirical studies using meta-analytic techniques, five separate effects emerge with considerable consistency. Violent video games are significantly associated with: increased aggressive behavior, thoughts, and affect; increased physiological arousal; and decreased prosocial (helping) behavior. Average effect sizes for experimental studies (which help establish causality) and correlational studies (which allow examination of serious violent behavior) appear comparable (Anderson & Bushman, 2001).

Myth 2. The studies that find significant effects are the weakest methodologically.
Facts: Methodologically stronger studies have yielded the largest effects (Anderson, in press). Thus, earlier effect size estimates -based on all video game studies- probably underestimate the actual effect sizes.

Myth 3. Laboratory experiments are irrelevant (trivial measures, demand characteristics, lack external validity).
Facts: Arguments against laboratory experiments in behavioral sciences have been successfully debunked many times by numerous researchers over the years. Specific examinations of such issues in the aggression domain have consistently found evidence of high external validity. For example, variables known to influence real world aggression and violence have the same effects on laboratory measures of aggression (Anderson & Bushman, 1997).

Myth 4. Field experiments are irrelevant (aggression measures based either on direct imitation of video game behaviors (e.g., karate kicks) or are normal play behaviors.
Facts: Some field experiments have used behaviors such as biting, pinching, hitting, pushing, and pulling hair, behaviors that were not modeled in the game. The fact that these aggressive behaviors occur in natural environments does not make them "normal" play behavior, but it does increase the face validity (and some would argue the external validity) of the measures.

Myth 5. Correlational studies are irrelevant.
Facts: The overly simplistic mantra, "Correlation is not causation," is useful when teaching introductory students the risks in too-readily drawing causal conclusions from a simple empirical correlation between two measured variables. However, correlational studies are routinely used in modern science to test theories that are inherently causal. Whole scientific fields are based on correlational data (e.g., astronomy). Well conducted correlational studies provide opportunities for theory falsification. They allow examination of serious acts of aggression that would be unethical to study in experimental contexts. They allow for statistical controls of plausible alternative explanations.

Myth 6. There are no studies linking violent video game play to serious aggression.
Facts: High levels of violent video game exposure have been linked to delinquency, fighting at school and during free play periods, and violent criminal behavior (e.g., self-reported assault, robbery).

Myth 7. Violent video games affect only a small fraction of players.
Facts: Though there are good theoretical reasons to expect some populations to be more susceptible to violent video game effects than others, the research literature has not yet substantiated this. That is, there is not consistent evidence for the claim that younger children are more negatively affected than adolescents or young adults or that males are more affected than females. There is some evidence that highly aggressive individuals are more affected than nonaggressive individuals, but this finding does not consistently occur. Even nonaggressive individuals are consistently affected by brief exposures. Further research will likely find some significant moderators of violent video game effects, because the much larger research literature on television violence has found such effects and the underlying processes are the same. However, even that larger literature has not identified a sizeable population that is totally immune to negative effects of media violence.

Myth 8. Unrealistic video game violence is completely safe for adolescents and older youths.
Facts: Cartoonish and fantasy violence is often perceived (incorrectly) by parents and public policy makers as safe even for children. However, experimental studies with college students have consistently found increased aggression after exposure to clearly unrealistic and fantasy violent video games. Indeed, at least one recent study found significant increases in aggression by college students after playing E-rated (suitable for everyone) violent video games.

Myth 9. The effects of violent video games are trivially small.
Facts: Meta-analyses reveal that violent video game effect sizes are larger than the effect of second hand tobacco smoke on lung cancer, the effect of lead exposure to I.Q. scores in children, and calcium intake on bone mass. Furthermore, the fact that so many youths are exposed to such high levels of video game violence further increases the societal costs of this risk factor (Rosenthal, 1986).

Myth 10. Arousal, not violent content, accounts for video game induced increases in aggression.
Facts: Arousal cannot explain the results of most correlational studies because the measured aggression did not occur immediately after the violent video games were played. Furthermore, several experimental studies have controlled potential arousal effects, and still yielded more aggression by those who played the violent game.

Myth 11. If violent video games cause increases in aggression, violent crime rates in the U.S. would be increasing instead of decreasing.
Facts: Three assumptions must all be true for this myth to be valid: (a) exposure to violent media (including video games) is increasing; (b) youth violent crime rates are decreasing; (c) video game violence is the only (or the primary) factor contributing to societal violence. The first assumption is probably true. The second is not true, as reported by the 2001 Report of the Surgeon General on Youth Violence (Figure 2-7, p. 25). The third is clearly untrue. Media violence is only one of many factors that contribute to societal violence and is certainly not the most important one. Media violence researchers have repeatedly noted this.

Theory

One frequently overlooked factor in this debate is the role of scientific theory. Pure empirical facts often have relatively little meaning and are seldom convincing. When those same facts fit a broader theory, especially one that has been tested in other contexts, those facts become more understandable and convincing. Recent years have seen considerable progress in basic theoretical models of human aggression (for recent integrations see Anderson & Bushman, 2002b; Anderson & Huesmann, in press; Anderson & Carnagey, in press).

Most such models take a social cognitive view of human aggression, integrating social learning theory, advances in cognitive psychology, script theory, developmental theories, and biological influences. Using such general models, media violence scholars now have a clear picture of how media violence increases aggression in short and long term contexts. Immediately after exposure to media violence, there is an increase in aggressive behavior tendencies because of several factors. 1. Aggressive thoughts increase, which in turn increase the likelihood that a mild or ambiguous provocation will be interpreted in a hostile fashion. 2. Aggressive affect increases. 3. General arousal (e.g., heart rate) increases, which tends to increase the dominant behavioral tendency. 4. Direct imitation of recently observed aggressive behaviors sometimes occurs.

Repeated media violence exposure increases aggression across the lifespan because of several related factors. 1. It creates more positive attitudes, beliefs, and expectations regarding use of aggressive solutions. 2. It creates aggressive behavioral scripts and makes them more cognitively accessible. 3. It decreases the accessibility of nonviolent scripts. 4. It decreases the normal negative emotional reactions to conflict, aggression, and violence.

Unanswered Questions

Several major gaps remain in the violent video game literature. One especially large gap is the lack of longitudinal studies testing the link between habitual violent video game exposure and later aggression, while controlling for earlier levels of aggression and other risk factors. Indeed, of the four major types of empirical studies mentioned earlier, this is the only type missing. There are such studies focusing on television violence but none on video games.

Another gap concerns potential differences in effect sizes of television versus video game violence. There are theoretical reasons to believe that violent video game effects may prove larger, primarily because of the active and repetitive learning aspects of video games. However, this is a very difficult question to investigate, especially with experimental designs. How does one select violent video game and television stimuli that are matched on other dimensions? On what dimensions should they be equivalent? Number of bodies? Amount of blood and gore? Realism of the images? There are a couple of unpublished correlational studies that have compared the effects of television and video game violence on aggression, using comparable measures of violence exposure. Both yielded results suggesting a larger effect of video game violence. But the issue is not settled.

Finally, more research is needed to: (a) refine emerging general models of human aggression; (b) delineate the processes underlying short and long term media violence effects; (c) broaden these models to encompass aggression at the level of subcultures and nations. Several different research groups around the world are working on these various issues.

1. Historical Accounts of Exploitation

Although the term “exploitation” appears not to have been used to describe unfair advantage-taking prior to the 19th century, there are nevertheless extensive discussions of the themes and problems that characterize contemporary discussions of exploitation in the history of philosophy. Those themes include the notion of justice and injustice in economic exchange, the role of labor in the creation of value, and the justification and abuse of private property, especially in capital and land.
1.1 Pre-Marxian Accounts of Exploitation and Unjust Trade

Concerns about exploitation often take the form of unfair economic exchange. Attempts to specify the principles that render an exchange fair or unfair can be traced back at least as far as Aristotle, who argued that a just exchange will embody a kind of reciprocity such that the values of the goods exchanged are proportional (Nicomachean Ethics, Book V, Part V). But while the notion of proportionality is intuitively appealing, it is somewhat unclear precisely what Aristotle had in mind by it, or what the most defensible explication of the idea would be. To borrow Aristotle’s own example, if a shoemaker and a builder trade, how many pairs of shoes is proportional to a single house?

In the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas, we find the beginnings of a much more sophisticated and promising approach to questions such as this. In his Summa Theologiae, Aquinas sought to answer the question of “whether a man may lawfully sell a thing for more than it is worth?” The “worth” of a thing, for Aquinas, was its just price. And the just price, according to Aquinas, appears to have been simply the prevailing market price (Summa Theologiae, part 2, second part, question 77; see also de Roover 1958 and Friedman 1980). Rather than relying on some fixed notion of proportionality, Aquinas’ just price will be responsive to considerations of supply and demand. But not just any price that two individuals mutually agree upon will be deemed just on Aquinas’ standard. Thus, a seller who takes advantage of fraud, or a temporary monopoly, to charge an excessive price for an item would be acting unjustly, insofar as his price is in excess of the price at which similar goods typically sell in the relevant market. But Aquinas saw nothing inherently sinful in selling a good for more than one paid for it, or with charging enough to earn a profit, or to compensate for risks involved in the productive process. Seeking profit for its own sake may involve a certain sort of “debasement”, but profit can also be sought in order to fulfill necessary or even virtuous ends.

Later Scholastics would devote considerable attention to developing and refining the notion of the just price. Of special concern was the price attached to the lending of money, or interest. Since the founding of the Catholic church, it was widely regarded as sinful for lenders to charge interest on their loans, and so-called “usury” was prohibited by canon and often by secular law. Much of the concern regarding usury seems to have been driven by the idea that the charging of interest involves an inequitable exchange—lenders give something to borrowers, but demand back more than they have given. But Aquinas seems to have been particularly concerned that borrowers would often be driven to take out loans out of necessity, and thus that their consent to the exchange is not fully voluntary (Summa Theologiae, part 2, second part, question 78).

The much later natural law theorist John Locke also took up questions regarding just and unjust prices, not in either of his well-known treatises on government but in a lesser known tract titled, Venditio. Locke, even more explicitly than Aquinas, saw the just price as being equivalent to “the market price at the place where he sells” (Locke 1661: 340). The relativity of the just price to the particular market in which the transaction takes place is important. For Locke argued that if two ships sailed laden with corn, one to Dunkirk where there is a near famine taking place, and the other to Ostend where normal conditions obtain, it would not be unjust for the merchant to sell at a significantly higher price in the former location than in the latter (so long as the higher price is one that the buyers can afford). If the merchant did not charge a higher price, Locke argued, then two problems would result. First, it is likely that the merchant’s goods would simply be bought by speculators and resold on a secondary market, thereby simply redirecting the profit into somebody else’s hands without doing anything to improve the situation of buyers. And second, if merchants cannot charge a high price in “good” markets to cover their losses in “bad” ones, they will soon operate at a net loss and this will, Locke claims, “quickly put an end to merchandising” (Locke 1661: 342).

What would be unjust would be for the merchant to sell an item to a particular individual for a price higher than the general market rate as might happen, for instance, if that individual is in particular distress. Thus, Locke holds, if anchors typically sell for a certain price, say 100 pounds, then it would be unjust (exploitative) to charge the captain of a distressed ship 5000 pounds for an anchor, simply because one knows he will be compelled to pay it. The just price is the going market rate, where that rate is determined by the general features of supply and demand, and not the particular needs or vulnerabilities of any particular buyer or seller.

Interest in exploitation as a feature of economic exchange is thus almost as old as philosophy itself. It was not until the 19th century, however, that exploitation as a feature of employment relationships came to be a subject of philosophical and political concern. In a sense, of course, the employment relationship is simply another instance of economic exchange, with the laborer selling his or her work in exchange for money in the form of wages. But two ideas led many people to think that there was something special about labor. The first was a belief that labor is the ultimate source of all economic value. The second was the belief that labor morally entitles the laborer to the full value of that which he or she has produced.

More will be said about the first of these ideas in the discussion of Marx’s theory of exploitation, below. The second idea, and its connection to the idea of labor exploitation, is perhaps best illustrated by the theory put forth by the 19th century liberal Thomas Hodgskin. For Hodgskin, as for Locke from whose ideas he drew heavily, the right of private property is a natural, pre-political right. That right consists in

    the right of individuals, to have and to own, for their own separate use and enjoyment, the produce of their own industry, with power freely to dispose of the whole of that in the manner most agreeable to themselves. (Hodgkin 1832: 24)

But while the natural right of property is based on labor, there is also an artificial right of property that is based on nothing more than legislative force. That artificial right cements in place, through the machinery of government, property claims that had their origins not in labor but in violence, conquest, and theft. And it thereby enables capitalists to profit without labor, simply by virtue of their (illegitimate) control of the means of production (Reeve 1987b).

For Hodgskin, capitalists exploit workers in precisely the same way that landlords exploit their tenants. In both cases, one person is entitled to a stream of revenue simply by virtue of their legal claim of ownership (Hodgskin 1832: 97). The money the landlord earns as rent comes from the wages the tenant earns as a laborer, just as the money the capitalist earns as profit comes from the sale of products produced by his laborers. In both cases, one person is able to live as a parasite off the productive activities of others, all because the state actively suppresses the natural right of laborers to the full product of their labor, in favor of the artificial right of property established by violence.

Even before Marx, then, we see in the 19th century a tight connection between theories of exploitation and theories of class and of class conflict. Marx himself credited the “bourgeois economists” of the French Industrialist school with having pioneered the economic analysis of class struggle (Marx & Engels 1965: 69). For members of that school, the two great classes into which society was divided were productive laborers and unproductive social parasites. The class of productive laborers was understood broadly to encompass not only those who exerted physical labor to create tangible goods and services, but anyone who worked to make goods more useful than they would otherwise be—so laborers, yes, but also entrepreneurs, arbitrageurs, and even capitalists in their role as managers and overseers of investments. The unproductive classes, in contrast, consisted of those who consume value but do not produce it, such as the army, the government, and the state-supported clergy (Raico 1977: 395).

According to Industrialists such as Charles Comte and Jean-Baptiste Say, the unproductive classes are able to maintain themselves by using the coercive power of government to forcibly extract resources from the productive. Taxes and tariffs were the most obvious forms such “plunder” could take, but the same goal could also be achieved by special protections for favored industries including the limited conferral of monopoly power (Say 1964: 146–147).

For both Hodgskin and for the Industrialists, then, the state was a key agent in facilitating the exploitation of one class of individuals by another, and the most certain way to end exploitation was therefore to sharply limit the power of the state and to strengthen the “natural” right of private property. But not all theorists of the 19th century saw things this way. For Ricardian Socialists such as John Bray, ending exploitation would require ensuring that all persons have equal access to the means of production, and thereby guaranteeing a system of equal exchange based on the labor theory of value (Bray 1839). While Hodgskin and the Industrialists sought to purify capitalism from statist interference, Bray and his fellow socialists sought to eliminate it altogether.
1.2 Marx’s Theory of Exploitation

By far the most influential theory of exploitation ever set forth is that of Karl Marx, who held that workers in a capitalist society are exploited insofar as they are forced to sell their labor power to capitalists for less than the full value of the commodities they produce with their labor.

For Marx, however, exploitation was a phenomenon that characterized all class-based societies, not only capitalism. Indeed, it is feudal society, not capitalism, where the exploitative nature of class relations is clearest. Under feudalism, it is readily apparent that serfs use some of their labor power for their own benefit, while another part (the corvée) is used for the benefit of the feudal lord. In contrast, under slavery workers appear to work entirely for the benefit of their masters (though in reality a part of their labor goes toward providing for their own subsistence). And under capitalism workers appear to work entirely for the benefit of themselves, selling their labor to capitalists as free independent contractors (Cohen 1978: 332–3).

In reality, Marx thought, workers’ labor under capitalism is neither truly voluntary nor entirely for the benefit of the workers themselves. It is not truly voluntary because workers are forced by their lack of ownership of the means of production to sell their labor power to capitalists or else starve. And workers are not laboring entirely for their own benefit because capitalists use their privileged position to exploit workers, appropriating for themselves some of the value created by workers’ labor.

To understand Marx’s charge of exploitation, it is first necessary to understand Marx’s analysis of market prices, which he largely inherited from earlier classical economists such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo. Under capitalism, Marx argued, workers’ labor power is treated as a commodity. And because Marx subscribed to a labor theory of value, this means that just like any other commodity such as butter or corn, the price (or wage) of labor power is determined by its cost of production—specifically, by the quantity of socially necessary labor required to produce it. The cost of producing labor power is the value or labor-cost required for the conservation and reproduction of a worker’s labor power. In other words, Marx thought that workers under capitalism will therefore be paid just enough to cover the bare necessities of living. They will be paid subsistence wages.

But while labor power is just like any other commodity in terms of how its price is determined, it is unique in one very importance respect. Labor, and labor alone, according to Marx, has the capacity to produce value beyond that which is necessary for its own reproduction. In other words, the value that goes into the commodities that sustain a worker for a twelve-hour work day is less than the value of the commodities that worker can produce during those twelve hours. This difference between the value a worker produces in a given period of time and the value of the consumption goods necessary to sustain the worker for that period is what Marx called surplus value.

According to Marx, then, it is as though the worker’s day is split into two parts. During the first part, the laborer works for himself, producing commodities the value of which is equal to the value of the wages he receives. During the second part, the laborer works for the capitalist, producing surplus value for the capitalist for which he receives no equivalent wages. During this second part of the day, the laborer’s work is, in effect, unpaid, in precisely the same way (though not as visibly) as a feudal serf’s corvée is unpaid (Marx 1867).

Capitalist exploitation thus consists in the forced appropriation by capitalists of the surplus value produced by workers. Workers under capitalism are compelled by their lack of ownership of the means of production to sell their labor power to capitalists for less than the full value of the goods they produce. Capitalists, in turn, need not produce anything themselves but are able to live instead off the productive energies of workers. And the surplus value that capitalists are thereby able to appropriate from workers becomes the source of capitalist profit, thereby “strengthening that very power whose slave it is” (Marx 1847: 40).

In the first volume of Capital, Marx presents a series of formulas representing a tight relationship between labor, exploitation, and capitalist profit. According to Marx, the value of a commodity is a function of three factors: constant capital (C, the labor value of nonlabor means of production such as machines, buildings, and raw materials), variable capital (V, the labor value of the labor power of workers involved in production), and surplus value (S). Since surplus value comes from the exploitation of labor (rather than machines or land), Marx defined the rate of exploitation as the ratio of surplus value over variable capital (S/V). Of course, different industries will employ different mixes of labor and other factors of production—of variable and constant capital. Marx referred to this mixture as the organic composition of capital, and defined it as C/V. But since capitalist profit is generated by the exploitation of labor, it seems to follow that industries that employ a greater proportion of labor (of variable over constant capital) should therefore earn a higher rate of profit. Thus, Marx defined the rate of profit as (S/(C+V)), which is equivalent to the rate of exploitation divided by the organic composition of capital+1. This last proposition has been referred to by Jon Elster as the “fundamental equation of Marxian economics” (Elster 1986: 67).

Marx’s analysis of the rate of profit seems to entail that labor-intensive industries will be more profitable than industries that rely to a greater extent on constant capital. But this conclusion is clearly empirically false (Böhm-Bawerk 1898), and moreover incompatible with Marx’s assumption of a competitive economy in which investments will adjust so as to equalize the rate of profit between industries (Arnold 1990: Ch. 3; Buchanan 1985: Ch. 3). Marx himself recognized this fact, and sought to address it in the third volume of Capital by dropping the assumption of volume 1 that value and price are equivalent, and showing instead how value can be transformed into price through some more complicated process. Whether Marx’s attempted solution to this “transformation problem” was successful, however, is a matter of great controversy (Arnold 1990: Ch. 3; Samuelson 1971; Kliman 2007).

Marx’s theory of exploitation appears to presuppose that labor is the source of all value. But the labor theory of value to which Marx and early classical economists subscribed is subject to a number of apparently insurmountable difficulties, and has largely been abandoned by economists in the wake of the marginalist revolution of the 1870s. The most obvious difficulty stems from the fact that labor is heterogeneous. Some labor is skilled, some labor is unskilled, and there does not appear to be any satisfactory way of reducing the former to the latter and thereby establishing a single standard of measure for the value of commodities. Moreover, the labor theory of value appears to be unable to account for the economic value of commodities such as land and raw materials that are not and could not be produced by any human labor. Finally, and perhaps most fatally, Marx’s assumption that labor has the unique power to create surplus value is entirely ungrounded. As Robert Paul Wolff has argued, Marx’s focus on labor appears to be entirely arbitrary. A formally identical theory of value could be constructed with any commodity taking the place of labor, and thus a “corn theory of value” would be just as legitimate, and just as unhelpful, as Marx’s labor theory of value (Wolff 1981). Therefore, if, as some have alleged, Marx’s theory of exploitation is dependent on the truth of the labor theory of value, then a rejection of the labor theory of value should entail a rejection of Marx’s theory of exploitation as well (Nozick 1974; Arnold 1990).

Not everyone agrees, however, that Marx’s theory is dependent on the labor theory of value in this way. G.A. Cohen, for instance, argues that Marx’s theory of exploitation is not only independent of the labor theory of value, but incompatible with it (Cohen 1979: 345–6). Marx’s account of exploitation is premised on the claim that value created by workers is appropriated by capitalists. But the labor theory of value holds that the value of an object is a function of the labor that would be currently required to produce it, regardless of how much labor actually went into producing it. Paradoxical as it may seem, the labor theory of value is incompatible with the claim that labor alone creates value.

The real problem with exploitation, on Cohen’s view, is not that capitalists appropriate value that is created by labor. It is, rather, that capitalists appropriate some of the value of the products that are created by labor. Labor may not produce value, but it is the only thing that produces what has value, and this is all Marx needs to get his account of exploitation off the ground (Cohen 1979: 354).

But even if Cohen’s account of exploitation avoids commitment to the labor theory of value, it nevertheless remains committed to the Marxian idea that exploitation should be understood as the forced appropriation of surplus value. And there are at least two respects in which this commitment is problematic. First, it is unclear whether exploitation necessarily involves the forced transfer of surplus value. Marx’s account asserts that the laborer is forced to work for capitalists because the only alternative is starvation. But suppose the government provides a safety net sufficient to ensure that workers’ subsistence needs are met. If someone chooses to work in order to earn discretionary income, it still seems possible that they could be exploited by a capitalist who appropriates some of the value of the product the laborer creates (Kymlicka 2002: 179). A laborer can be exploited, we might think, by being paid an unfair wage even if that laborer is not forced to work.

Second, it is unclear whether all cases involving the forced transfer of surplus value are necessarily exploitative, at least in the ordinary sense of involving a moral wrong. Suppose that governments tax workers and use some of the proceeds to provide support for children or the infirm. If it is exploitative for capitalists to appropriate some of the value of the objects produced by workers, is it not also exploitative for government to do so through the mechanism of taxation? Some libertarians have argued that this is precisely how we should understand the coercive power of government. For Cohen, however, the fact that Marx’s account of exploitation appears to be committed to the libertarian idea of that workers own their labor and the products they produce with that labor—that is, to the libertarian idea of self-ownership—is deeply problematic (Cohen 1995: Ch. 6).
2. The Concept of Exploitation

In its broadest sense, transactional/micro-level exploitation involves an agent, A, taking unfair advantage of another agent, B. Taking unfair advantage, in turn, can be understood in two ways. First, it can refer to some dimension of the outcome of the exploitative act or transaction. In this case, we say that the transaction is substantively unfair. Second, to say that A takes unfair advantage of B may imply that there is some sort of defect in the process by which the unfair outcome has come about, for example, that A has coerced B or defrauded B or has manipulated B. In this case, we say that the transaction is procedurally unfair.

This section examines several elements or possible elements of transactional exploitation: the benefit that exploitative transactions confer upon A, the harm they cause to B, various notions of substantive and procedural unfairness, and the unjust background conditions against which exploitative transactions may take place.
2.1 Exploitation and Benefit

When A exploits B, A gains some benefit from interacting with B. We can see the relevance of the “benefit to A” by contrasting exploitation with other forms of wrongdoing, such as discrimination, abuse, and oppression. Let us say that A discriminates against B when A wrongly deprives B of some opportunity or benefit because of some characteristic of B that is not relevant to A’s action. There was a period in American history in which many women became public school teachers because they were denied the opportunity to enter other professions such as law and medicine. To the extent that society benefitted (in one way) from the pool of highly qualified public school teachers, the discrimination may have been exploitative, even if unintentionally so. But if A refuses to hire B solely because of B’s race, then it would be odd to say that A exploits B, for A does not gain from the wrong to B.

Consider abuse. It has been alleged that medical students are frequently abused by verbal insults and denigration and that this abuse may leave long-lasting emotional scars. It is also sometimes claimed that medical interns are exploited, that they work long hours for low pay. The contrast is just right. There is no reason to think that anyone gains (in any normal sense) from abuse, but it is at least plausible to think that the hospitals or patients gain from the exploitation of interns.

Let us say that A oppresses B when A deprives B of freedoms or opportunities to which B is entitled. If A gains from the oppressive relationship, as when A enslaves B, then A may both oppress and exploit B. But if A does not gain from the oppression, the oppression is wrong but not exploitative. We might say that the unemployed are oppressed, but unless we could specify the ways in which some gain from their lack of employment, the unemployed are not exploited. Marxists would claim that capitalists pay exploitative wages to the employed precisely because there is a “reserve army” of the unemployed with whom the employed must compete. But that merely confirms that they are exploited because the oppression generates a gain to the capitalist class, and it is the employed who are exploited and not the unemployed that make such exploitation possible.

Clearly, an exchange still counts as exploitative even if A does not benefit on net. If A derives unfair benefit from his interaction with B, but suffers unforeseen costs such that she ends up worse-off after the interaction than she was before, then A has still exploited B. Less clear is the question of whether A must derive any actual benefit at all, or whether it is enough that A merely intend to benefit. Suppose a sweatshop owner works his employees ruthlessly in order to extract as much profit as he can from the workers’ labor, but that the product the laborers produce turns out, due to an unforeseen turn of events, to have zero market value. Have the sweatshop workers nevertheless been exploited?

Related to the question of whether A’s intent to benefit is sufficient for exploitation is the question of whether A’s intent to benefit unfairly is necessary for exploitation. Is it possible to exploit someone by mistake? Can one foresee that one’s interaction will be exploitative without intending it to be so? If so, is A still culpable? (Ferguson 2016b)
2.2 Exploitation and Harm

Exploitation thus involves A unfairly benefitting from an interaction with B. But what exactly does it mean to benefit unfairly? One natural response to this question is to conceive of unfairness as benefitting A at B’s expense. Perhaps exploitation advances the interests of A while harming B. Exploitation, thus understood, is a kind of parasitism. Or, as Allen Buchanan defines it, exploitation is “the harmful, merely instrumental utilization of him or his capacities, for one’s own advantage or for the sake of one’s own ends” (Buchanan 1985: 87).

Certain paradigmatic cases of exploitation clearly fit this analysis. Slavery is an exploitative relationship, and one that clearly harms slaves for the benefit of their masters. But as Alan Wertheimer has noted, some exploitation appears to be mutually advantageous rather than harmful (Wertheimer 1996: 14). Someone who charges a hiker lost in the desert $1,000 for a bottle of water takes unfair advantage of her. Nevertheless, the transaction is one from which both parties emerge better off relative to how they would have been, had the transaction not taken place. The seller has traded away something she values less (the bottle of water) for something she values more ($1,000). But so has the buyer. If the water is necessary to save her life, and if she values her life more than the $1,000 she gives up to save it, then she too is better off with the transaction than without it.

In this way, exploitation is importantly different from coercion, even though both coercion and exploitation can involve individuals accepting proposals that appear to make them better off relative to some baseline. In a paradigmatic case of coercion—a mugger who demands “your money or your life”—the victim is better off handing over the money than losing her life. But she would be better off still if the mugger had never showed up to make her proposal at all. In contrast, the stranded hiker would be considerably worse off if her exploiter never showed up. Coercion characteristically involves threats by which the coercer proposes to make her victim worse off unless she does as the coercer demands. Exploitation, in contrast, often involves offers by which the exploiter proposes to make her victim better off if she does as the exploiter proposes.

There is, however, one important sense in which even an exploiter could be said to harm her victim. Relative to a baseline of no transaction at all, exploitation often makes its victim better off. But relative to a baseline of a fair transaction, exploitation leaves its victim worse off. In this sense, an exploiter’s gain does, contra Joel Feinberg, come at the victim’s expense (Feinberg 1988: 178). For even when both parties gain from the transaction, the victim of exploitation gains less than she should because some of the “cooperative surplus” to which she is by fairness entitled has been captured by the exploiter.

Exploitation therefore does not necessarily harm its victim in the sense of making her worse off than she would have been, had the exploiter never interacted with her at all. Rather, it makes its victim worse off than she should have been, had she been treated fairly. As with similar cases involving coercion, the precise details of our analysis thus depend on the relevant baseline against which we choose to compare B’s situation after the interaction. But these details probably do not matter much as far as our all-things-considered moral evaluation is concerned. Whether we choose to say that exploitation involves A making B better off, but not as much better off as A should have made B; or whether we say that it involves making B worse off than B should have been, the final verdict is the same (Wertheimer 1996: 22–23).
2.3 Exploitation and Fairness

In the sense in which we are using the term, exploitation necessarily (conceptually) involves unfairness. Our sense of exploitation is thus a moralized term. To judge that someone is engaged in exploitation is already to pass a moral judgment on them—to say that they are acting wrongly (at least in a pro tanto sense). Not all uses of “exploitation” are moralized in this way. As we noted at the beginning of this entry, some ordinary language use of the term implies no moral judgment whatsoever. And it is possible to develop a philosophically sophisticated account of exploitation that is relevant to moral judgment, without being moralized (Goodin 1987).

Still, even if exploitation is not conceptually unfair, it is characteristically so. In some cases, this unfairness is the result of some procedural defect in the transaction—call this procedural unfairness. In other cases, the unfairness is a feature of what is agreed to, rather than how the agreement is reached—call this substantive unfairness.
2.3.1 Procedural Fairness

A transaction will be exploitative due to procedural unfairness when A unfairly utilizes or creates a defect in the process of the transaction with B in way that benefits A at B’s expense (though see the previous section for an analysis of “at B’s expense”). So, for instance, if A deceives B regarding the nature of the good A is selling, in a way that leads B to pay more for that good than B otherwise would have, we can say that A has taken unfair advantage of B—that A has exploited B. Or if A unfairly pressures B to agree to A’s proposed terms—threatening to physically hurt B or someone B loves, for instance—we can again say that A has exploited B.

But while we can (correctly) say that A has exploited B in these situations, we could also say, more directly and more clearly, that A has defrauded or coerced B. That is, we already have a rich set of more narrowly-tailored terms for identifying the ways in which A might undermine the validity of B’s consent to the terms of their agreement. For this reason, it seems superfluous—and indeed, it is rare—to describe these sorts of procedural defects as “exploitative”. At least when A creates the defect from which he benefits, we usually have a better term available to describe the specific form of his wrongdoing.

The label “exploitation” seems more appropriate when A unfairly takes advantage of an existing defect (Jansen and Wall 2013). A teenage boy who trades five pennies for his 5 year-old brother’s single quarter exploits his brother insofar as he takes unfair advantage of his ignorance of monetary units. But he does not coerce him, nor does he necessarily deceive him. Similarly, a psychotherapist who takes advantage of his patient’s therapy-induced romantic feelings to engage in sexual relations can be said to exploit his patient, even if there is no outright fraud or deception in the interaction (and even if the substantive “terms” of their relationship are in no way unfair). In these cases, exploitation seems to be the most apt description for the wrongdoing.
2.3.2 Substantive Fairness

There is widespread agreement among philosophers and legal theorists on the broad categories of behavior that render a transaction procedurally unfair, even if there is (as always) persistent disagreement about borderline cases of coercion, fraud, etc. In contrast, there is much less agreement regarding those conditions that render a transaction substantively unfair.
2.3.2.1 Equality

One of the most intuitively appealing criteria of fairness in exchange is equality. A fair exchange, it is tempting to say, is an equal exchange. But equal in terms of what?

Although Marx took pains to deny he was giving an account of justice (let alone fairness), much of the intuitive force of his account of labor exploitation seems to rely on the idea that a fair exchange will embody equal transfers of socially necessary labor. It is because the objects produced by the worker embody more socially necessary labor than the wages he receives in exchange for producing those objects that the laborer is exploited. And other late-19th century theorists such as Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews made this moral claim explicit. “It is clear”, wrote Andrews,

    if [an] exchange is not equal, if one party gives more of his own labor—either in the form of labor or product—than he gets of the labor of the other…that he is oppressed, and becomes, so far as this inequality goes, the slave or subject of the other. (Andrews 1852: 52–53)

But even though a theory of labor-time as the basis of fair exchange is in principle distinguishable from a labor theory of economic value, the former is subject to many of the same problems as the latter. How, for instance, should the difference between skilled and unskilled labor time be accounted for in determining a fair exchange? Between easy and difficult labor? Labor is not homogenous, and this makes it ill-suited to serve as a currency of fair exchange.

If labor is the wrong place to look for a criterion of fair exchange, perhaps economic value would be better. A fair trade, on this view, involves the exchange of equally valuable goods or services. And an unfair trade involves the exchange of goods or services of unequal value. To return to an earlier example, someone who sells a bottle of water to a hiker stranded in the desert for $1,000 takes unfair advantage of her. And part of what makes the exchange unfair is that the bottle of water simply isn’t worth nearly $1,000. B is giving up far more than she gains in exchange.

Or is she? Once we give up on the 19th century notion that economic value is an objective property of commodities, and embrace instead that value is a function of the subjective preferences of economic agents, the problem with this analysis becomes readily apparent. Economic exchange is only possible precisely because different agents assign different values to the same object. I sell you my old television for $75 because I’ve bought a new set, and to me, the old television is worth less than the $75. You pay the $75 because you just moved into a new place and, to you, the $75 is worth less than the television. Neither of our valuations is the “right” one. Our preferences simply differ, and so it is possible for us to both walk away from the deal believing—correctly!—that we have gotten more than we have given up.

Cooperative exchanges create what economists call a “social surplus”. Suppose, to continue the television example, that I’d be willing to take anything equal to or greater than $50 in exchange for my television, and that you’d be willing to pay anything equal to or less than $100 for it. If, after bargaining, we arrive at a sale price of $75, then I give up something I value at $50 in exchange for $75, and come away $25 richer, and you give up $75 in exchange for something you value at $100 and walk away $25 richer. All together, we’re $50 richer. That’s the social surplus.

This suggests one final possible egalitarian analysis of fair exchange. Perhaps what makes an exchange is fair is not that the objects traded have equal economic value, but rather the equal division of the social surplus created by the exchange of objects of unequal subjective value. Exploitative exchanges, in contrast, are those in which one party commands a disproportionately large share of the social surplus, leaving the other party with an unfairly small share. For example, suppose that an employer gains $10 per hour worth of value from an employee’s labor. An employer like that could afford to pay its workers $9 per hour and still make a profit. But if potential employees have nowhere else to go, why should the employer pay that much? Why not pay employees as little as she can get away with—maybe $3 an hour, just barely over the subsistence level of $2? In this case the employment relationship would generate a social surplus of $8. But $7 of that surplus would go into the pocket of the employer, while only $1 goes to the laborer. Might not that lopsided division of the social surplus be precisely what’s unfair, and thus exploitative, about this kind of labor?

Perhaps. But the unequal division of the social surplus cannot explain all cases of exploitation—including some of the most paradigmatic. To see this, let us return once more to the case of the lost desert hiker. A offers to sell B a bottle of water for $1,000. This would appear to be a clear instance of an exploitative proposal. But it is not, as suggested above, because the water bottle is worth less than $1,000 to B. Indeed, it is probably worth far more! Most people put a fairly high value on their continued existence. So, suppose B values not dying at $1 million. In that case, B gives up something he values at $1,000 in exchange for something he values at $1 million. A, in turn, gives up something he values at close to $0 in exchange for something he values at $1,000. The exchange creates a social surplus of $1 million, but fully 99.9% of that surplus goes to B, leaving A with a mere .1%. If exploitation consists of grabbing the lion’s share of the social surplus of an exchange, then we are forced to conclude that thirsty B is actually exploiting water-selling A—an unlikely result!
2.3.2.2 Respect for Persons and Basic Needs

It is thus difficult to specify an egalitarian criterion of fairness that explains the wrongfulness of exploitation across a range of cases. For this reason, most current theories of exploitation are not fundamentally egalitarian in nature. Some, like those put forward by Allen Wood, Ruth Sample, and Jeremy Snyder, are based in the Kantian idea of respect for persons. Sample, for instance, defines exploitation as “interacting with another being for the sake of advantage in a way that fails to respect the inherent value in that being” (Sample 2003: 57). According to Sample, one can fail to respect the inherent value of others in several distinct ways. One way involves failing to respond appropriately to the unmet basic needs of others. Respect for others imposes upon us an imperfect duty of beneficence, a duty that Jeremy Snyder argues is “specified” when we come face to face with particular others and thereby takes on a perfect, strict form (Snyder 2008: 390). When we encounter others whose basic needs are unmet, we should help them because of the inherent value they possess as a human being. But the exploiter sees in the unmet basic needs of others not a cry for help but as an opportunity for profit.

Sample’s and Snyder’s respect-based accounts are simultaneously more narrow and more broad than fairness-based accounts of exploitation. They are broader insofar as they will condemn as exploitative transactions that might pass as non-exploitative on a fairness approach. Selling a bottle of water at a normal market price to the hiker lost in the desert, for instance, might be fair but still insufficiently responsive to the hiker’s unmet basic need for drink. But the accounts are also considerably narrower than fairness-based accounts insofar as the range of goods or transactions to which they apply is more circumscribed. On both Sample’s and Snyder’s accounts, for instance, it is not wrongfully exploitative for a seller to use his knowledge of a buyer’s unusually strong desire for a painting to charge that buyer an extremely high price. Because the buyer’s basic needs are not implicated, charging a high price in this sort of cases does not signal disrespect for persons, even if the price is one that would otherwise appear to be unfairly high.

Sample’s account, like Goodin’s, holds that taking advantage of certain kinds of vulnerability is wrongfully exploitative regardless of how those vulnerabilities came about. But as Benjamin Ferguson has noted, this has the potential to create a certain kind of moral hazard problem (Ferguson 2016b). Suppose that A knows that, should he become vulnerable for whatever reason, B will be obligated to constrain B’s advantage over A—perhaps by selling B goods for less than the normal market price. Given this knowledge, A might be tempted to take a risky gamble, knowing that if it doesn’t turn out well, B will be obligated to partly subsidize A’s loss. In effect, B’s obligation toward A puts B in a position of vulnerability, a vulnerability that A has the potential to unfairly take advantage of. In other words, A’s obligation not to exploit B renders A vulnerable to exploitation by B! In order to avoid this difficulty, it seems necessary to limit the kinds of vulnerabilities that trigger the obligation to constrain one’s advantage, perhaps by ruling out vulnerabilities for which the agent is morally responsible.
2.3.2.3 Unjust Property Relations

Many have found plausible Marx’s claim that employment relationships under capitalism are exploitative. But perhaps Marx was wrong to locate that exploitation in the particular details of the capitalist-employee relationship. After all, what makes exploitation possible at all on Marx’s view is a feature of the macro level distribution of property in society—specifically capitalists’ monopoly over the means of production. Marx’s formal theory of exploitation, however, makes no explicit mention of this property relation, focusing instead entirely on the interaction between capitalists and laborers at the point of production. The result, according to John Roemer, is a theory that is focused too much on the micro level of particular employment relationships and not enough on the macro level background of inegalitarian property distribution against which those relationships take place (Roemer 1982).

On Roemer’s analysis, capitalist exploitation is essentially a form of social parasitism. One group (the capitalists) are made better off by the existence of a second group (workers), but that second group is made worse off by the existence of the first. More formally, according to Roemer’s account, we may say that a group S is exploited by S′ if and only if all of the following three conditions are satisfied:

    If S were to withdraw from the society, endowed with its per capita share of society’s alienable property (that is, produced and nonproduced goods), and with its own labor and skills, then S would be better off (in terms of income and leisure) than it is at the present allocation.[1]
    If S′ were to withdraw under the same conditions, then S′ would be worse off (in terms of income and leisure) than it is at present.
    If S were to withdraw from society with its own endowments (not its per capita share), then S′ would be worse off than at present.

Suppose workers form the coalition S, and capitalists form the coalition S′. Workers are exploited, on Roemer’s view, because property rights in the means of production are monopolized by capitalists. If workers were to withdraw from society with a per capita share of society’s alienable assets, including the means of production, they would be better off than they are right now (condition 1 is satisfied). If capitalists were to withdraw with only their per capita share of society’s alienable assets, they would be worse off since some of their currently held share would go to workers (condition 2 is satisfied). Finally, if workers to withdraw from society with only the assets to which they are entitled under their existing legal regime—their bodies and their labor—then capitalists would be worse off, since they would no longer be able to profit by exploiting workers labor (condition 3 is satisfied). What this shows is that the existing distribution of property makes capitalists better off at workers’ expense. It is a parasitic, exploitative arrangement.

Roemer’s account coheres well with the intuitive sense of exploitation as unfair treatment over a wide range of cases. In cases where we think that an inegalitarian distribution of property has been unjustly produced, then a system that puts that distribution to use to benefit one class at the expense of another will seem wrongfully exploitative. This, presumably, is the point of Marx’s account of the “primitive accumulation” of capital, which aims to show that capitalists’ monopoly over the means of production is the product of violence and theft rather than hard work and thrift (Marx 1867: Ch. 26).

But even if actually existing capitalism’s history is tainted in this way, it is possible to imagine an inegalitarian distribution of property emerging, in Robert Nozick’s language, “from a just situation by just steps” (Nozick 1974: 151). Suppose a society begins with an egalitarian distribution and evolves, through a mix of voluntary choices and luck—but no procedural injustices such as force or fraud—into a society with significant inequalities. Such a society might contain a relatively poor coalition S that would do better if it appropriated some of the alienable property belonging to relatively wealthy S′ and withdrew with a per capita share of society’s alienable assets (condition 1). And S′ would, in turn, be worse off if it was able to withdraw with only a per capita share of those assets (condition 2). Finally, if S and S′ are engaged in mutually beneficial exchange in the present society, then S′ might well be worse off if S were to withdraw from society, even if S took only its own assets (condition 3). A society such as this satisfies all of Roemer’s conditions for exploitation. But it is far from clear that there is anything wrongful or unjust in it.

Roemer’s account also runs into the same difficulty as those Marxist accounts that view the forced transfer of surplus value as necessarily exploitative. It seems forced to condemn a society in which the able-bodied and well-off are taxed to support children and the infirm as exploitative, since the able-bodied would be better off if they withdrew with their own resources, while children and the inform would be worse off (Elster 1982). Roemer attempts to grapple with this problem by stipulating that exploitation involves something more than the satisfaction of conditions 1 through 3, and suggests that the missing condition might be a relationship of “dominance” of the exploiter over the exploited. But as Will Kymlicka has noted, this stipulation seems

    ad hoc, since [it is] disconnected from the ‘ethical imperative’ that [Roemer] identifies as the basis of exploitation theory (Kymlicka 2002: 204 n. 13). And Roemer himself admits that lack of clarity regarding the concept of dominance prevents his account from being a “satisfactory analytical account of exploitation. (Roemer 1982: 304 n. 12).

Even if Roemer’s account were entirely satisfactory on its own terms, however, it would still seem to leave a large, important class of questions about exploitation unanswered. Precisely because Roemer’s account is focused on “macro” issues pertaining to the distribution of property in society, it has little to say about “micro” issues regarding how individuals treat each other within the framework created by that distribution (Ferguson and Steiner 2016: 13–14). Intuitively, it seems possible for individuals to treat each other exploitatively even within a just distribution of property; and it likewise seems possible for individuals to treat each other fairly within an unjust distribution of property. That Roemer’s account does not address these issues of micro-level treatment is not necessarily a flaw in the theory. But it does suggest, at the very least, that a different or more comprehensive theory of exploitation is necessary to supplement Roemer’s exclusively macro-level approach.
2.3.2.4 Harmful Parasitism

Giijs van Donselaar’s account of exploitation is based on the idea that exploitation is a form of harmful parasitism. An exploitative relationship, for Donselaar, is one that involves “worsening the position of others in bettering one’s own” (van Donselaar 2009: 7). In such a relationship, A uses and benefits from B, but B would be better off if A had never existed or never interacted with him at all. So, for example, if A homesteads a plot of land by mixing his labor with it only because he knows B wants the land and will be willing to pay him a large sum of money for it, then A exploits B in the Donselaarian sense. Or, similarly, if A proposes to build a second story to his home only because his neighbor B will be willing to pay him not to do it in order to preserve his view, then A exploits B. In cases like these, A acts within his rights, but he “abuses” his rights to extract benefits from B.

Intuitively, there seems to be something unfair about the kinds of activities van Donselaar has identified as exploitative. But there are also activities that satisfy his criteria for exploitation that do not seem intuitively unfair. Many cases of ordinary market competition, for instance, involve situations of this sort. Suppose that A and B compete for a job and that A, being the more highly qualified candidate, is offered the position. A accepts, and then offers B a job as her secretary. In this situation, A gains by interacting with B, but B would be better off if A never existed at all. Likewise, if B is a disabled citizen who is offered a taxpayer-financed stipend by the government, then B benefits from the existence of taxpayer A, while A is worse off than she would be if B had never existed. As Richard Arneson notes, “one man’s parasitism is another man’s distributive justice” (Arneson 2013: 9).
2.3.2.5 Domination

The second challenge faced by van Donselaar is nearly identical to a difficulty we discussed above with John Roemer’s property-relations account of exploitation. And as we have seen, Roemer himself suggested one way of avoiding the difficulty—namely, adding a dominance condition to his account of exploitation. Intuitively, capitalists at least have the capacity to dominate their employees, but disabled people living on a pension do not dominate taxpayers, nor do they have the capacity to do so.

Nicholas Vrousalis elaborates on what he sees as a tight connection between the concepts of exploitation and domination (Vrousalis 2013). According to Vrousalis, A exploits B if and only if A and B are embedded in a systematic relationship in which A instrumentalizes B’s vulnerability to extract a net benefit from B. And A dominates B if A and B are embedded in a systematic relationship in which A takes advantage of his power over B, or the power of a coalition of agents A belongs to, in a way that is disrespectful to B. Exploitation, then, is a particular form of domination—domination for self-enrichment. Capitalists exploit workers insofar as they treat workers as objects, using their power and workers’ vulnerability to extract value from workers, all embedded in the systematic relationships of a capitalist economy.

Vrousalis’s focus on systems is intended to rehabilitate the most defensible elements of a broadly Marxian theory of exploitation, and to establish exploitation as a concept distinct from mere unfairness (Vrousalis 2014). But divorcing exploitation from unfairness has its cost, for there are examples that fit Vrousalis’s schema for exploitation that do not seem unfair, and because they do not seem unfair, do not seem wrongful. If A is a monopoly provider of heating oil, and B lives in a cold climate, A has power over B and B is vulnerable. But, intuitively, A does not have to take advantage of that vulnerability. A could sell to B at a fair price—i.e., a price lower than the maximum price that B would, if necessary, be willing to pay. If she does so, A will still extract a net benefit from B, thereby satisfying Vrousalis’s definition of exploitation. But it is far from obvious that A will have acted in any way wrongly (Arneson 2013: 4).
2.4 Exploitation and Background Conditions

In addition to failing to respond appropriately to others’ basic needs, Sample also argues that exploitation can take the form of taking advantage of past injustice (Sample 2003: 74). If A uses the fact that B is disadvantaged as a result of past injustice for his own profit then, Sample argues, A has failed to treat B with respect and has exploited him for his own gain.

In setting forth this claim, Sample builds a certain historical element into her account of exploitation. What matters, on her view, is not merely whether a person in a position of vulnerability is taken advantage of, but how it came about that such advantage-taking was possible.

Other exploitation theorists have made similar claims. Hillel Steiner’s account of exploitation, for example, holds that exploitation occurs when A gains more from an interaction, and B gains less, than they would have were it not for the existence of a prior injustice (Steiner 1984). So, for example, if A hires B as a laborer and is able to pay B a low wage of $2 per hour only because A (or someone else) has previously unjustly deprived B of alternative sources of labor, then A has exploited B. If, on the other hand, the explanation for B’s earning only $2 does not involve injustice—if B simply does not have very valuable skills, or if there is a large supply of (not unjustly) unemployed laborers, then a $2 wage, no matter how insufficient it might be to meet B’s needs, and no matter how much more A could afford to pay, is not exploitative.

On the other hand, some theorists have argued that the source of vulnerability is irrelevant to the exploitative nature of a transaction. Robert Goodin, for instance, argues that exploitation consists in “playing for advantage in situations where it is inappropriate to do so”, and involves a violation of the moral norm of “protecting the vulnerable”. Importantly, Goodin holds that this norm applies “regardless of the particular source of their vulnerability” (Goodin 1987: 187). Thus, whether a worker is economically vulnerable because of a past injustice or whether her vulnerability derives from a normal fluctuation of the business cycle is irrelevant. To use that vulnerability to press one’s own advantage is exploitative.

Similarly, Matt Zwolinski argues that whether an exchange is exploitative or not depends on the terms of the transaction itself, not on how the parties came to be in their respective ex ante positions. Cases like the desert hiker, Zwolinski argues, show that exploitation can occur in the absence of past injustice and thus that taking advantage of past injustice is not a necessary component of exploitation. And neither is it a sufficient condition, for we can imagine cases where parties gain from past injustice without thereby engaging in exploitation. If B’s home is unjustly burned to the ground by an arsonist, and a contractor A charges B a normal market price to rebuild it, then A has not exploited B, despite the fact that A has profited from the injustice suffered by B (Zwolinski 2012: 172).
3. The Moral Weight and Force of Exploitation

The primary task of a theory of exploitation is to set forward the truth conditions for the claim, “A exploits B”. Beyond this purely conceptual project, however, there remain two more straightforwardly normative tasks. Adopting terminology from Alan Wertheimer, we can describe the first of these tasks as providing an account of the moral weight of exploitation, where moral weight refers to the intensity of exploitation’s wrongness. The second task is to provide an account of the moral force of exploitation, where moral force is understood to refer to “the various moral upshots of reasons for action that exploitation might or might not involve for parties to the transaction or for society” (Wertheimer 1996: 28).

When exploitation is harmful and nonconsensual, issues of both moral weight and force are relatively unproblematic. Whatever the added moral importance of the gain to A from the harm to B, it is certainly at least prima facie wrong for A to harm B and it seems that the state is at least prima facie justified in prohibiting or refusing to enforce such transactions. But exploitation that takes place in the context of mutually advantageous and consensual transactions presents a more difficult set of problems. First, regarding the issue of moral weight, it might be thought that even if a transaction between A and B is unfair, there can be nothing seriously wrong about an agreement from which both parties benefit, particularly if A has no obligation to enter into any transaction with B. At the very least, it seems difficult to show how a mutually advantageous (but unfair) interaction can be morally worse than no-interaction at all since, ex hypothesi, there is no party to the transaction for whom it is worse. In the recent literature on exploitation, this thought has been formulated more precisely as the “non-worseness claim”:

NWC: Interaction between A and B cannot be worse than non-interaction when A has a right not to interact with B at all, and when the interaction is mutually advantageous, consensual, and free from negative externalities (Wertheimer 1996, 2011; Zwolinski 2009; Powell and Zwolinski 2012).

Most exploitation theorists are skeptical that the NWC is correct (Wertheimer 1996; Bailey 2010; Arneson 2013; Barnes 2013; Malmqvist 2016). For if it were, then it would seem to be a mistake to blame individuals who engage in certain forms of mutually beneficial exploitation—for example, those who engage in “price gouging” by selling electrical generators to victims of natural disasters at inflated prices. (Zwolinski 2008). After all, we usually would not blame those individuals if they stayed home and did nothing. But, so long as people are willing to pay the high prices (and no coercion or fraud is involved), both parties are better off with the transaction than without it. So how could it be morally worse to provide those customers with some benefit than it is to provide them with no benefit at all?

Of course, the NWC need not lead to a deflationary account of the wrongness of exploitation. It could, instead, lead to an inflationary account of the wrongness of non-interaction. In other words, we can account for the NWC’s claim that mutually beneficial exploitation is not worse than non-interaction either by saying that mutually beneficial exploitation is less wrong than we thought it was, or by saying that non-interaction is worse than we thought it was: by saying that price gougers are less blameworthy than we thought, or by saying that those who stay home and do nothing to help victims of disaster are more blameworthy than we thought.

Even if mutually beneficial exploitation really is a serious moral wrong, however, it might not be a kind of wrong that can justify state intervention (Wertheimer 1996: Ch. 9). In other words, the question of the moral force of exploitation cannot be settled entirely by reference to its moral weight. Suppose A is a price gouger who sells bottles of water to disaster victims for $12 each. Even if A acts wrongly or fails to act virtuously, it is arguable that A does not harm anyone or violate anyone’s rights, and only harm or rights violations justify state intervention. If the state cannot force A to sell the water to B, it might be thought completely irrational for the state to prohibit A and B from entering into a consensual and mutually advantageous transaction.

Moreover, there is a real danger that preventing mutually beneficial but exploitative transactions will wind up “consigning the vulnerable person to an even worse fate than being exploited” (Wood 1995: 156). After all, persons who are exploited are taken advantage of because of some antecedent vulnerability—a lack of access to clean drinking water, in the example above. Preventing exploitative transactions by itself does nothing to alleviate this vulnerability. Indeed, by depriving vulnerable parties of one possibility for improving their situation by engaging in a mutually beneficial transaction, such interference might actually exacerbate it.

Perhaps this view is correct. Bracketing arguments based on externalities, it seems perfectly plausible to maintain that the state is justified in interfering with transactions only if one party is violating the other’s rights. That said, those who invoke the concept of exploitation frequently maintain that such exploitation provides a reason for state intervention. For example, when it is claimed that commercial surrogacy exploits the birth mothers, the critics typically argue that surrogacy contracts should be unenforceable or entirely prohibited. Similar things are said about the sale of bodily organs. Those who make such arguments do frequently claim that the transactions are nonconsensual or harmful, but they seem prepared to make such arguments even if the transactions are consensual and mutually advantageous.

On what grounds might we justify interfering with consensual and mutually advantageous exploitative transactions? It might be thought that we could interfere on paternalistic grounds. A paternalistic argument could not justify interfering with exploitative transactions if the exploitative transaction is advantageous to B and if interference is not likely to result in a transaction that is more beneficial to B. For paternalism justifies interfering for someone’s good, and this interference would not be to the target’s benefit. But there might be situations in which B knows enough to agree only to those exploitative transactions that are beneficial (as compared with no transaction), but does not know that less exploitative transactions are available. And so there may be a “soft paternalist” justification for interference with some mutually advantageous exploitative transactions.

We might also justify interfering with exploitative transactions on strategic grounds. Suppose that A enjoys a monopoly position, say, as a potential rescuer of B. If we prohibit A from charging an exorbitant price for his services, then A might offer his services for a reasonable price. This argument would not justify interfering in a highly competitive market, for, under such conditions, A would not and could not offer his services for a better price. But there may be numerous situations in which such strategic arguments can work (Wertheimer 1996).

It is worth noting, however, that prohibiting exploitative transactions is not the only way in which the state or other moral agents might attempt to respond to its wrongful nature. Prohibition is an example of what Allen Wood describes as “interference”. But in addition to interference, Wood suggests that we can think of redistribution as a way in which third parties such as the state might attempt to prevent exploitation (Wood 1995: 154). After all, exploitation is only possible because B is in a position of vulnerability relative to A. One way to prevent exploitation, then, is to address this vulnerability directly—to channel resources to B so as to remove the hardship that makes him vulnerable to exploitation in the first place. If workers in the developing world had an adequate social safety net to fall back on, for instance, they would be less inclined to accept a job with the harsh conditions of a sweatshop, and therefore less vulnerable to exploitation by their employers.
4. Applied Issues in Exploitation Theory

Questions about exploitation arise in a wide variety of different contexts, not just in the domain of political philosophy but in various areas of applied ethics as well such as business ethics, biomedical ethics, and environmental ethics. In addition to the topics discussed briefly below, the concept of exploitation has played a central role in debates over payday lending (Mayer 2003), clinical research in the developing world (Hawkins and Emanuel 2008), markets for human organs (Hughes 1998; Taylor 2005), guest worker programs (Mayer 2005), and price gouging (Zwolinski 2008).
4.1 Universal Basic Income

Some theorists, such as Philippe van Pairjs, have argued that justice requires that the state institute a universal basic income (UBI). A UBI is a cash transfer, funded by taxes, that would be paid to all citizens regardless of need, and regardless of whether they are working, or even willing to work (van Parijs 1995). Against this, some critics have charged that a basic income would facilitate a form of exploitation. As Stuart White argues,

    where others bear some cost in order to contribute to a scheme of cooperation, then it is unfair for one to willingly enjoy the intended benefits of their cooperative efforts unless one is willing to bear the cost of making a relevantly proportionate contribution to this scheme of cooperation in return. (White 1997: 317–318)

As is so often the case in dealing with exploitation claims, assessing this objection requires us to grapple with a complicated mix of empirical and normative claims. On the empirical side, for instance, we might ask whether a basic income really would lead to a net increase in reciprocity-violating transfers. Some theorists have argued that a basic income would actually increase incentives to work relative to currently existing welfare programs, by lowering the effective marginal tax rate faced by low-wage workers (Tobin 1966). Others have emphasized the role of unpaid labor in the economy, such as domestic labor, and argued that a basic income would lead to a fairer application of the reciprocity principle than welfare systems that condition benefits on doing paid work (Pateman 2004). Normatively, the objection challenges us to think about both what the ideal of reciprocity requires and how it fits within a system of broader distributive justice. Some advocates of basic income have argued that a liberal-egalitarian theory of justice is correct and requires an equal distribution of scarce resources such as land rent and the rent component of wages (van Parijs 1997: 329). Reciprocity may be an important political value, such theorists argue, but it is one that is to be applied only after people have been given what they are due at the basic level of justice.
4.2 Sweatshop Labor

The term “sweatshop” is usually used to refer places of employment that utilize low-skill workers, often in the developing world, and that are characterized by low wages, long hours, and unsafe working conditions. In many cases, sweatshops produce goods on contract for large, multinational enterprises, who then sell those goods to customers in wealthier societies.

Many critics see sweatshop labor as highly exploitative. A large part of the debate over this claim has focused on the issue of wages. Critics claim that sweatshops have a moral obligation to pay a living wage to their workers. This duty is grounded in the extreme need of sweatshop workers, the fact that sweatshops and the multinational enterprises with which they contract rely on them to produce the goods that they sell, and the fact that the multinational enterprises are profitable enough that they can afford to increase workers’ wages without jeopardizing the health of their business (Meyers 2004; Snyder 2008). Some critics, however, see sweatshops’ low wages as merely one symptom of a broader failure to respect workers as persons who are ends in themselves. That failure of respect manifests itself in sweatshops violation of legal labor standards, their exposure of workers to physically dangerous conditions, and their abuse and coercion of workers on the job (Arnold and Bowie 2003: 227–233).

Once again, a number of difficult empirical and normative issues come out in this debate. The empirical issues include not only questions about what conditions in sweatshops are actually like—how low wages actually are relative to other firms in the developing economy, for instance—but what effects various attempts to remedy sweatshop conditions would actually have. Would a higher legal minimum wage improve workers’ overall well-being, or would it instead lead to layoffs and plant relocations (Powell and Zwolinski 2012)? On the normative side, the Non-Worseness Condition seems to pose an especially significant challenge to critics of sweatshop labor. If sweatshops, by providing jobs and capital infusion in the developing world, provide some benefit to workers there, how can they be acting in a morally worse way than wealthy firms that do not outsource their production at all, and thus provide no benefit to needy workers abroad (Zwolinski 2007; Preiss 2014)? Another question: even if we grant that sweatshops exploit their workers, and that exploitation is a significant moral wrong, might it be a wrong that is all-things-considered justifiable if sweatshop labor nevertheless confers considerable benefits on current workers, and plays an important role in economic growth? In other words, how much weight should a valid claim of exploitation have in our overall judgment of the justice of a practice or of a set of institutions that permit that practice?
4.3 Commercial Surrogacy

Commercial surrogacy is a practice in which a woman is paid to become pregnant as a result of either artificial insemination or the implantation of an already fertilized egg, and to surrender her parental rights to the intended parent(s). In the United States, most surrogacy arrangements are purely domestic affairs (with both the intended parents and the surrogate being citizens of the United States), but a significant number are international, in which the surrogate mother is often a citizen of a much poorer country.

Both types of surrogacy arrangement have been subjected to criticism on a number of distinct grounds. Some have argued that surrogacy involves an objectionable form of “commodification”, while others have argued that the practice is harmful to children, or to women as a class. But many have also argued that the practice exploits the women who serve as surrogates. In the case of international surrogacy, this charge is usually based on the bad circumstances and low pay of the women who serve as surrogates. The lack of alternative sources of employment has been said to undermine women’s consent, and the compensation they receive is often extremely low compared to the pay received by American surrogates for the same service—sometimes as low as 10%.

In the case of domestic surrogacy, critics charge that surrogate mothers are young and do not fully understand the physical and psychological risks that attend the services they are agreeing to provide. As a result, the arrangement might be harmful on net to them despite the fact that they consent to it. Or, even if it is not harmful on net, the payment they receive might be inadequate compensation for the costs they incur, thus rendering surrogacy a case of mutually beneficial but unfair and exploitative exchange (Tong 1990).

Questions of fair compensation for surrogates raise many of the same issues, and give rise to many of the same debates, as are found in the literature on sweatshop labor (Wilkinson 2003). But unlike the sort of labor that takes place in sweatshops, some critics believe that commercial surrogacy arrangements are intrinsically wrong. If women’s reproductive labor is not the sort of service that should be sold at any price, then commercial surrogacy may involve a kind of exploitation insofar as it entices women to engage in an activity that is harmful to their moral character (Anderson 1990; Wertheimer 1996: Ch. 4).

Brutalism
https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Brutalism

Brutalism
Welbeck Street Car Park2.jpg

Brutalism, also known as Brutalist architecture, is a style that emerged in the 1950s and grew out of the early-20th century modernist movement. Brutalist buildings are characterised by their massive, monolithic and ‘blocky’ appearance with a rigid geometric style and large-scale use of poured concrete. The movement began to decline in the 1970s, having been much criticised for being unwelcoming and inhuman.

The term ‘brutalism’ was coined by the British architects Alison and Peter Smithson, and popularised by the architectural historian Reyner Banham in 1954. It derives from ‘Béton brut’ (raw concrete) and was first associated in architecture with Le Corbusier, who designed the Cite Radieuse in Marseilles in the late-1940s.

Brutalism became a popular style throughout the 1960s as the austerity of the 1950s gave way to dynamism and self-confidence. It was commonly used for government projects, universities, car parks, leisure and shopping centres, and high-rise blocks of flats.

Brutalism became synonymous with the socially progressive housing solutions that architects and town planners promoted as modern ‘streets in the sky’. With an ethos of ‘social utopianism’, together with the influence of constructivist architecture, it became increasingly widespread across European communist countries such as the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia.

Brutalism was generally characterised by its rough, unfinished surfaces, unusual shapes, heavy-looking materials, straight lines, and small windows. Modular elements were often used to form masses representing specific functional zones, grouped into a unified whole. As well as concrete, other materials commonly used in Brutalist buildings included brick, glass, steel, and rough-hewn stone.

As high-rise buildings became associated with crime, social deprivation and urban decay, so Brutalism was increasingly reviled, and across the UK, many Brutalist buildings were demolished. Typical of this adverse reaction was the demolition in 2019 of the multi-storey car park in Welbeck Street, London W1. However, Brutalism has continued to influence later forms, associated with high-tech architecture and deconstructivism. In recent years, it has been critically reappraised, with certain buildings being seen as architectural landmarks.

Some key examples of Brutalism include:
Cite Radieuse, France
Park Hill, Sheffield
Queen Elizabeth Hall, London
Preston Bus Station, Preston
Barbican Estate, London
Trellick Tower, London.
Welbeck Street car park (demolished 2019)

Sperm Donor has to pay for Child Support
https://edition.cnn.com/2014/01/23/justice/kansas-sperm-donation/index.html
A Kansas sperm donor caught in the middle of a child support case says he wanted to help a lesbian couple when he made the donation nearly five years ago.
Instead, he may end up paying for his action.
A judge ruled that William Marotta must pay child support, even though he says he signed documents waiving his parental rights.
Shawnee County District Court Judge Mary Mattivi said on Wednesday that Marotta failed to conform to Kansas law, which says a licensed physician must be involved in an artificial insemination process, court documents show.
The documents show that the lesbian couple whom Marotta helped conceive a child say they performed the artificial insemination procedure at home.


Lawyer blames political motivations
His lawyer, Ben Swinnen, accused the state, where same-sex marriage is not legal, of being politically motivated in its pursuit of his client. "The cost to the state to bring this case far outweighs any benefit the state would get," said Swinnen, adding his client has no other children. Swinnen said the state is asking for $4,000 to recoup the money it has spent. It is also asking Marotta to pay child support, which could run into tens of thousands of dollars, he said. Swinnen said the Kansas court has failed to address many of the challenges brought forward by Marotta, under the guise of statutory interpretation of the law requiring the donor sperm to be provided to a licensed physician. "From a very narrowly crafted statute, the court has made a very broad rule -- that is the issue," Swinnen said. Swinnen said he planned to appeal the decision.

Marotta: "I'm not her parent"
Marotta said he met the child once -- a few months ago -- when he and his wife by chance crossed paths with one of the girl's parents at an area carnival. He said he had no intention of assuming a paternal role. "I'm not her parent," he said. But under Kansas law, he is her father. Had a physician carried out the insemination, that would not be the case, because Marotta would be able to document that he was a sperm donor and not the lover of the girl's mother, CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen said. "For all they know, they were lovers," she said. "They need that documentation. He's the dad; he ought to be paying up."

In 2004, Mark Zuckerberg Broke Into A Facebook User's Private Email Account
https://www.businessinsider.com/how-mark-zuckerberg-hacked-into-the-harvard-crimson-2010-3?IR=T

In the spring of 2004, Mark Zuckerberg used data from his successful new web site, TheFacebook.com, to hack into the email accounts of two Harvard Crimson journalists. Facebook CEO and cofounder Mark Zuckerberg now runs a site that 400 million people visit each month. But back in May 2004, he was a 19-year-old finishing up his sophomore year at Harvard. He was also the acclaimed founder and creator of an increasingly popular Web site called TheFacebook.com, which had launched in February 2004.

Mark used his site, TheFacebook.com, to look up members of the site who identified themselves as members of the Crimson.  Then he examined a log of failed logins to see if any of the Crimson members had ever entered an incorrect password into TheFacebook.com.  If the cases in which they had entered failed logins, Mark tried to use them to access the Crimson members' Harvard email accounts.  He successfully accessed two of them.

In other words, Mark appears to have used private login data from TheFacebook to hack into the separate email accounts of some TheFacebook users.

In one account he accessed, Mark saw an email from Crimson writer Tim McGinn to Cameron, Tyler, and Divya. Another email Mark read was this one, from Crimson managing editor Elisabeth Theodore to Tim McGinn:

The True Story Of A Man-Eating Tiger's 'Vengeance'
John Vaillant


Prologue

HANGING IN THE TREES, AS IF CAUGHT THERE, IS A SICKLE OF A MOON.

Its wan light scatters shadows on the snow below, only obscuring further the forest that this man negotiates now as much by feel as by sight. He is on foot and on his own save for a single dog, which runs ahead, eager to be heading home at last. All around, the black trunks of oak, pine, and poplar soar into the dark above the scrub and deadfall, and their branches form a tattered canopy overhead. Slender birches, whiter than the snow, seem to emit a light of their own, but it is like the coat of an animal in winter: cold to the touch and for itself alone. All is quiet in this dormant, frozen world. It is so cold that spit will freeze before it lands; so cold that a tree, brittle as straw and unable to contain its expanding sap, may spontaneously explode. As they progress, man and dog alike leave behind a wake of heat, and the contrails of their breath hang in pale clouds above their tracks. Their scent stays close in the windless dark, but their footfalls carry and so, with every step, they announce themselves to the night.

Despite the bitter cold, the man wears rubber boots better suited to the rain; his clothes, too, are surprisingly light, considering that he has been out all day, searching. His gun has grown heavy on his shoulder, as have his rucksack and cartridge belt. But he knows this route like the back of his hand, and he is almost within sight of his cabin. Now, at last, he can allow himself the possibility of relief. Perhaps he imagines the lantern he will light and the fire he will build; perhaps he imagines the burdens he will soon lay down. The water in the kettle is certainly frozen, but the stove is thinly walled and soon it will glow fiercely against the cold and dark, just as his own body is doing now. Soon enough, there will be hot tea and a cigarette, followed by rice, meat, and more cigarettes. Maybe a shot or two of vodka, if there is any left. He savors this ritual and knows it by rote. Then, as the familiar angles take shape across the clearing, the dog collides with a scent as with a wall and stops short, growling. They are hunting partners and the man understands: someone is there by the cabin. The hackles on the dog's back and on his own neck rise together.

Together, they hear a rumble in the dark that seems to come from everywhere at once.

There are many people who don't believe this actually happened. They think it's some phantasm of my imagination. But it was real. There are the facts. -- Yuri Anatolievich Trush

Shortly after dark on the afternoon of December 5, 1997, an urgent message was relayed to a man named Yuri Trush at his home in Luchegorsk, a mid-sized mining town in Primorye Territory in Russia's Far East, not far from the Chinese border. Primorye (Pri-mor-ya) is, among other things, the last stronghold of the Siberian tiger, and the official on the line had some disturbing news: a man had been attacked near Sobolonye, a small logging community located in the deep forest, sixty miles northeast of Luchegorsk. Yuri Trush was the squad leader of an Inspection Tiger unit, one of six in the territory whose purpose was to investigate forest crimes, specifically those involving tigers. Because poachers were often involved, these included tiger attacks. As a result, this situation -- whatever it might entail -- was now Trush's problem and, right away, he began preparing for the trip to Sobolonye.

------

Early the following morning -- Saturday -- Yuri Trush, along with his squadmates Alexander Gorborukov and Sasha Lazurenko, piled into a surplus army truck and rumbled north. Dressed in insulated fatigues and camouflage, and armed with knives, pistols, and semiautomatic rifles, the Tigers, as these inspectors are sometimes called, looked less like game wardens than like some kind of wilderness SWAT team. Their twenty-year-old truck was nicknamed a Kung, and it was the Russian army's four-ton equivalent to the Unimog and the Humvee. Gasoline-powered, with a winch, four-wheel-drive, and wide waist-high tires, it is a popular vehicle in Primorye's hinterlands. Along with a gun rack and brackets for extra fuel cans, this one had been modified to accommodate makeshift bunks, and was stocked with enough food to last four men a week. It was also equipped with a woodstove so that, even in the face of total mechanical failure, the crew could survive no matter where in the wilderness they happened to be.

After passing through the police checkpoint on the edge of town, the Tigers continued on up to a dirt road turnoff that led eastward along the Bikin River (be-keen), a large and meandering waterway that flows through some of the most isolated country in northern Primorye. The temperature was well below freezing and the snow was deep, and this slowed the heavy truck's progress. It also allowed these men, all of whom were experienced hunters and former soldiers, many hours to ponder and discuss what might be awaiting them. It is safe to say that nothing in their experience could have prepared them for what they found there.

Primorye, which is also known as the Maritime Territory, is about the size of Washington state. Tucked into the southeast corner of Russia by the Sea of Japan, it is a thickly forested and mountainous region that combines the backwoods claustrophobia of Appalachia with the frontier roughness of the Yukon. Industry here is of the crudest kind: logging, mining, fishing, and hunting, all of which are complicated by poor wages, corrupt officials, thriving black markets -- and some of the world's largest cats.

------

One of the many negative effects of perestroika and the reopening of the border between Russia and China has been a surge in tiger poaching. As the economy disintegrated and unemployment spread throughout the 1990s, professional poachers, businessmen, and ordinary citizens alike began taking advantage of the forest's wealth in all its forms. The tigers, because they are so rare and so valuable, have been particularly hard hit: their organs, blood, and bone are much sought after for use in traditional Chinese medicine. Some believe the tiger's whiskers will make them bulletproof and that its powdered bones will soothe their aches and pains. Others believe its penis will make them virile, and there are many -- from Tokyo to Moscow -- who will pay thousands of dollars for a tiger's skin.

Between 1992 and 1994, approximately one hundred tigers -- roughly one quarter of the country's wild population -- were killed. Most of them ended up in China. With financial assistance (and pressure) from international conservation agencies, the territorial government created Inspection Tiger in the hope of restoring some semblance of law and order to the forests of Primorye. Armed with guns, cameras, and broad police powers, these teams were charged with intercepting poachers and resolving a steadily increasing number of conflicts between tigers and human beings.

In many ways, Inspection Tiger's mandate resembles that of detectives on a narcotics detail, and so does the risk: the money is big, and the players are often desperate and dangerous individuals. Tigers are similar to drugs in that they are sold by the gram and the kilo, and their value increases according to the refinement of both product and seller. But there are some key differences: tigers can weigh six hundred pounds; they have been hunting large prey, including humans, for two million years; and they have a memory. For these reasons, tigers can be as dangerous to the people trying to protect them as they are to those who would profit from them.

The territory covered by Yuri Trush's Inspection Tiger unit in the mid-1990s was centered around the Bikin (be-keen) River. You can drive a truck on the Bikin in winter, but in summer it has a languid bayou feel. For many of the valley's jobless inhabitants, the laws imposed by the river and the forest are more relevant than those of the local government. While most residents here poach game simply to survive, there are those among them who are in it for the money.

-----

In 1997, Inspection Tiger had been in existence for only three years; given the state of the Russian economy in the 1990s, its members were lucky to have jobs, particularly because they were paid in dollars by foreign conservation groups. Four hundred dollars a month was an enviable wage at that time, but a lot was expected in return. Whether they were doing routine checks of hunters' documents in the forest, searching suspect cars en route to the Chinese border, or setting up sting operations, most of the people Inspection Tiger dealt with were armed. As often as not, these encounters took place in remote areas where backup was simply not available, and they never knew what they were going to find.

Following perestroika, virtually everything in Russia went on sale, and vast quantities of military ordnance disappeared from local armories. In the course of their raids on the many anonymous hunting cabins that dot the forest here, Trush and his men confiscated plastic explosives, TNT, and 12mm (.50 caliber) machine guns, robbed from armored vehicles. Trush could not imagine what one would do with guns that size in the forest, but the explosives were easier to explain: they were used in creeks to kill fish en masse, or to blow bears out of their dens. The Asian market is less interested in the intact skins or carcasses of bears than it is in their paws and gall bladders; the paws go into soup, and the gall bladders are used for medicinal purposes. In Primorye, in the mid-1990s, life, for man and animal alike, was cheap, and corruption was widespread at every level of government. During these years, Trush made busts involving high-ranking police officers and members of parliament, and these were dangerous enemies for a person to have. Trush, however, was well suited to this work because he is a formidable adversary, too.

Trush stands about six-foot-two with long arms and legs and a broad chest. His eyes are colored, coincidentally, like the semiprecious stone tiger's eye, with black rings around the irises. They peer out from a frank and homely face framed by great, drooping brows. Though frail and sickly as a boy, Trush had grown into a talented athlete with a commanding presence, a deep resonant voice, and an ability to remain composed under highly stressful circumstances. He is also immensely strong. As a young soldier in Kazakhstan, in the 1970s, Trush won a dozen regional kayaking championships for which he earned the Soviet rank Master of Sports, a distinction that meant he was eligible to compete at the national level. It was a serious undertaking: he wasn't just racing against Bulgarians and East Germans. "I was," he said, "defending the honor of the Military Forces of the USSR." In his mid-forties, when he joined Inspection Tiger, Trush won a territory-wide weightlifting competition three years running. This was not the kind of weightlifting one is likely to see in the Olympics; what Trush was doing looks more like a contest devised by bored artillerymen during the Napoleonic Wars. It consists of hefting a kettlebell -- essentially a large cannonball with a handle -- from the ground over your head as many times as you can, first with one hand, and then the other. Kettlebells are a Russian invention; they have been around for centuries and their use clearly favors the short and the stocky. So it is surprising to see someone as attenuated as Trush, who has the Law of the Lever weighted so heavily against him, heave these seventy-pound spheres around with such apparent ease.

Trush learned to shoot, first, from his father and, later, in the army. He also studied karate, aikido, and knife handling; in these, his rangy build works to his advantage because his long reach makes it nearly impossible to get at him. He is so talented at hand-to-hand fighting that he was hired to teach these skills to the military police. Trush's physicality is intense and often barely suppressed. He is a grabber, a hugger, and a roughhouser, but the hands initiating -- and controlling -- these games are thinly disguised weapons. His fists are knuckled mallets, and he can break bricks with them. As he runs through the motions of an immobilizing hold, or lines up an imaginary strike, one has the sense that his body hungers for opportunities to do these things in earnest. Referring to a former colleague who went bad and whom he tried for years to catch red-handed, Trush said, "He knows very well that I am capable of beheading him with my bare hands." This tension -- between the kind and playful neighbor, friend and husband, and the Alpha male wilderness cop ready to throw down at a moment's notice -- energizes almost every interaction. It is under the latter circumstances that Trush seems most alive.

-----

The deeper Trush and his men drove into the forest, the rougher the road became. Once past Verkhny Pereval, their route took them through the snowbound village of Yasenovie, a sister logging community of the same size and vintage as Sobolonye. Here, they picked up a young deputy sheriff named Bush, but his presence on this mission was more formal than practical. Bush was a cop, and tiger attacks were beyond his purview; however, if there was a body, he was required to witness it. With Bush onboard, they trundled on upriver.

It was already afternoon by the time they reached Sobolonye, an impoverished village of unpainted log houses, that at first glance seemed barely inhabited. Gorborukov was behind the wheel, and here he steered the truck off the main road, such as it was, and plunged into the forest on a track wide enough for only a single vehicle. Several inches of new snow had fallen earlier in the week and, as they drove, Trush scanned the roadside for fresh tracks. They were about fifty miles from the nearest paved road and a couple of hard-won miles east of Sobolonye when they crossed a wide and improbably located gravel highway. This road had been conceived during Soviet times as an alternative to Primorye's only existing north-south throughway, which follows the Ussuri River north to Khabarovsk (the same route used by the Trans-Siberian Railway). Despite handling every kind of traffic, including transcontinental freight trucks, the Ussuri road is poorly maintained and only as wide as a residential street; it was also considered vulnerable to Chinese attack. This new highway, though safer, wider, and ruler-straight, was never finished and so it is essentially a highway to nowhere -- in the middle of nowhere. The only people who benefit from it now are loggers, poachers, and smugglers -- pretty much the only people around who can afford a vehicle. But sometimes tigers use this highway, too.

There is an unintended courtesy in the winter forest that occurs around pathways of any kind. It takes a lot of energy to break a trail through the snow, especially when it's crusty or deep, so whoever goes first, whether animal, human, or machine, is performing a valuable service for those following behind. Because energy -- i.e., food -- is at a premium in the winter, labor-saving gifts of this kind are rarely refused. As long as the footpath, logging road, frozen river -- or highway -- is going more or less in the desired direction, other forest creatures will use it, too, regardless of who made it. In this way, paths have a funneling, riverlike effect on the tributary creatures around them, and they can make for some strange encounters.

The last three miles of the journey were on a logging track so tortuous and convoluted that even a veteran Russian backcountry driver is moved to shout, in a torrent of fricatives and rolling Rs, "Paris-Dakar! Camel Trophy!" It contoured east through the rolling woods, crossing creeks on bridges made of log piles stacked at right angles to the road. Two miles short of a privately owned logging camp, Gorborukov took an unmarked turn and headed north. After a few minutes, he pulled up at a clearing, on the far side of which stood a cabin.

The cabin belonged to Vladimir Markov, a resident of Sobolonye, and a man best known for keeping bees. The crude structure stood by itself on the high side of a gentle south-facing slope, surrounded by a thick forest of birch, pine, and alder. It was a lonely spot but a lovely one and, under different circumstances, Trush might have seen its appeal. Now there was no time; it was three o'clock in the afternoon and the sun was already in the southwest, level with the treetops. Any warmth generated during this brief, bright day was quickly dissipating.

The first sign of trouble was the crows. Carrion crows will follow a tiger the same way seagulls follow a fishing boat: by sticking with a proven winner, they conserve energy and shift the odds of getting fed from If to When. When Trush and his men climbed down from the Kung, they heard the crows' raucous kvetching concentrated just west of the entrance road. Trush noted the way their dark bodies swirled and flickered above the trees and, even if he hadn't been warned ahead of time, this would have told him all he needed to know: something big was dead, or dying, and it was being guarded.

Parked in front of Markov's cabin was a heavy truck belonging to Markov's good friend and beekeeping partner, Danila Zaitsev, a reserved and industrious man in his early forties. Zaitsev was a skilled mechanic and his truck, another cast-off from the military, was one of the few vehicles still functioning in Sobolonye. With Zaitsev were Sasha Dvornik and Andrei Onofrecuk, both family men in their early thirties who often hunted and fished with Markov. It was evident from their haggard appearance that they had barely slept the night before.

Judging from the density of tracks, there had clearly been a lot of activity around the cabin. Several different species were represented and their trails overlaid each other so that, at first, it was hard to sort them out. Trush approached this tangled skein of information like a detective: somewhere in here was a beginning and an end, and somewhere, too, was a motive -- perhaps several. Downhill from the cabin, closer to the entrance road, two tracks in particular caught his attention. One set traveled northward up the entrance road at a walking pace; the other traveled south from the cabin. They approached each other directly, as if the meeting had been intentional -- like an appointment of some kind. The southbound tracks were noteworthy, not just because they were made by a tiger, but because there were large gaps -- ten feet or more -- between each set of impressions. At the point where they met, the northbound tracks disappeared, as if the person who made them had simply ceased to exist. Here the large paw prints veered off to the west, crossing the entrance road at right angles. Their regular spacing indicated a walking pace; they led into the forest, directly toward the crows.

Trush had a video camera with him and its unblinking eye recorded the scene in excruciating detail. Only in retrospect does it strike one how steady Trush's hand and voice are as he films the site, narrating as he goes: the rough cabin and the scrubby clearing in which it stands; the path of the attack and the point of impact, and then the long trail of horrific evidence. The camera doesn't waver as it pans across the pink and trampled snow, taking in the hind foot of a dog, a single glove, and then a bloodstained jacket cuff before halting at a patch of bare ground about a hundred yards into the forest. At this point the audio picks up a sudden, retching gasp. It is as if he has entered Grendel's den.

The temperature is thirty below zero and yet, here, the snow has been completely melted away. In the middle of this dark circle, presented like some kind of sacrificial offering, is a hand without an arm and a head without a face. Nearby is a long bone, a femur probably, that has been gnawed to a bloodless white. Beyond this, the trail continues deeper into the woods. Trush follows it, squinting through his camera while his squad and Markov's friends trail closely behind. The only sounds are the icy creak of

Trush's boots and the distant barking of his dog. Seven men have been stunned to silence. Not a sob; not a curse. Trush's hunting dog, a little Laika, is further down the trail, growing increasingly shrill and agitated. Her nose is tingling with blood scent and tiger musk, and she alone feels free to express her deepest fear: the tiger is there, somewhere up ahead. Trush's men have their rifles off their shoulders, and they cover him as he films. They arrive at another melted spot; this time, a large oval. Here, amid the twigs and leaf litter, is all that remains of Vladimir Ilyich Markov. It looks at first like a heap of laundry until one sees the boots, luminous stubs of broken bone protruding from the tops, the tattered shirt with an arm still fitted to one of the sleeves.

Trush had never seen a fellow human so thoroughly and gruesomely annihilated and, even as he filmed, his mind fled to the edges of the scene, taking refuge in peripheral details. He was struck by the poverty of this man -- that he would be wearing thin rubber boots in such bitter weather. He reflected on the cartridge belt -- loaded but for three shells -- and wondered where the gun had gone. Meanwhile, Trush's dog, Gitta, is racing back and forth, hackles raised and barking in alarm. The tiger is somewhere close by -- invisible to the men, but to the dog it is palpably, almost unbearably, present. The men, too, can sense a potency around them -- something larger than their own fear, and they glance about, unsure where to look. They are so overwhelmed by the wreckage before them that it is hard to distinguish imminent danger from the present horror.

Save for the movements of the dog and the men, the forest has gone absolutely still; even the crows have withdrawn, waiting for this latest disturbance to pass. And so, it seems, has the tiger. Then, there is a sound: a brief, rushing exhale -- the kind one would use to extinguish a candle. But there is something different about the volume of air being moved, and the force behind it -- something bigger and deeper: this is not a human sound. At the same moment, perhaps ten yards ahead, the tip of a low fir branch spontaneously sheds its load of snow. The flakes powder down to the forest floor; the men freeze in mid-breath and, once again, all is still.

Since well before the Kung's engine noise first penetrated the forest, a conversation of sorts has been unfolding in this lonesome hollow. It is not in a language like Russian or Chinese, but it is a language nonetheless, and it is older than the forest. The crows speak it; the dog speaks it; the tiger speaks it, and so do the men -- some more fluently than others. That single blast of breath contained a message lethal in its eloquence. But what does one do with such information so far from one's home ground? Gitta tightens the psychic leash connecting her to her master. Markov's friends, already shaken to the core, pull in closer, too. The tiger's latest communication serves not only to undo these men still further, but to deepen the invisible chasm between them -- poachers to a man -- and the armed officials on whom their liberty and safety now depend. Markov's friends are known to Trush because

he has busted them before -- for possessing illegal firearms and hunting without a license. Of the three of them, only Zaitsev's gun is legal, but it is too light to stop a tiger. As for the others, their weapons are now hidden in the forest, leaving them more helpless than Trush's dog.

Trush is unarmed, too. There had been some back-and-forth at the entrance road about who was going to follow that grisly trail, and comments were made implying that Trush and his men didn't have what it took. Fear is not a sin in the taiga, but cowardice is, and Trush returned the challenge with a crisp invitation: "Poshli" -- "Let's go." One of Markov's friends -- Sasha Dvornik, as Trush recalled -- then suggested that Trush's team could handle it themselves. Besides, he said, they had no weapons. Trush called his bluff by urging him to fetch his unregistered gun from hiding. "This is no time to be confiscating guns," he said. "What's important now is to protect ourselves." Still, Dvornik hesitated, and this is when Trush offered him his rifle. It was a bold gesture on several levels: not only did it imply an expectation of trust and cooperation, but Trush's semiautomatic was a far better weapon than Dvornik's battered smoothbore. It also short-circuited the argument: now, there was no excuse, and no way that Dvornik -- with six men watching -- could honorably refuse. It was this same mix of shame, fear, and loyalty that compelled Zaitsev and Onofrecuk to go along, too. Besides, there was safety in numbers.

But it had been a long time since Dvornik was in the army, and Trush's weapon felt strangely heavy in his hands; Trush, meanwhile, was feeling the absence of its reassuring weight, and that was strange, too. He still had his pistol, but it was holstered and, in any case, it would have been virtually useless against a tiger. His faith rested with his squad mates because he had put himself in an extremely vulnerable position: even though he was leading the way, he did so at an electronic remove -- in this drama but not of it, exploring this dreadful surreality through the camera's narrow, cyclopean lens. Because Zaitsev and Dvornik couldn't be counted on, and Deputy Bush had only a pistol, the Tigers were Trush's only reliable proxies. Those with guns had them at the ready, but the forest was dense and visibility was poor. Were the tiger to attack, they could end up shooting one another. So they held their fire, eyes darting back and forth to that single, bare branch, wondering where the next sign would come from.

Behind the camera, Trush remained strangely calm. "We clearly see the tiger's tracks going away from the remains," he continued in his understated official drone, while Gitta barked incessantly, stiff-legged and staring. " ... the dog clearly indicates that the tiger went this way."

Up ahead, the tiger's tracks showed plainly in the snow, brought into sharp relief by the shadows now pooling within them. The animal was maneuvering northward to higher ground, the place every cat prefers to be. "It looks like the tiger's not too far," Trush intoned to future viewers, "around forty yards." The snow wasn't deep and, under those conditions, a tiger could cover forty yards in about four seconds. This may have been why Trush chose that moment to shut off his camera, reclaim his gun, and step back into real time. But once there, he was going to have to make a difficult decision.

In his professional capacity as senior inspector for Inspection Tiger, Trush acted as a medium between the Law of the Jungle and the Law of the State; one is instinctive and often spontaneous while the other is contrived and always cumbersome. The two are, by their very natures, incompatible. When he was in the field, Trush usually had no means of contacting his superiors, or anyone else for that matter; his walkie-talkies had limited range (when they worked at all) so he and his squad mates were profoundly on their own. Because of this, Trush's job required a lot of judgment calls, and he was going to have to make one now: the tiger is a "Red Book" species -- protected in Russia -- so permission to kill had to come from Moscow. Trush did not yet have this permission, but it was Saturday, Moscow might as well have been the moon, and they had an opportunity to end this now.

Trush decided to track it. This had not been part of the plan; he had been sent to investigate an attack, not to hunt a tiger. Furthermore, his team was short a man, dusk was coming on, and Markov's friends were a liability; they were still in shock and so, for that matter, was Trush. But at that moment, he was poised -- equidistant between the tiger and the harrowing evidence of what it had done. The two would never be so close again. Signaling Lazurenko to follow, Trush set off up the trail, knowing that every step would take him deeper into the tiger's comfort zone.

Men are drawn to borderline personality traits in physically attractive women, study finds
By Eric W. Dolan
6-8 minutes

Those with borderline personality disorder have problems regulating emotional impulses and often experience rocky relationships. But new research suggests that many men find traits associated with borderline personality disorder to be appealing in physically attractive women. The study has been published online in the journal Personality and Individual Differences.

The research was inspired by a viral parody video, in which a man provides scientific-sounding advice about the relationship between a woman’s physical appearance, personality, and her dating appeal.

“I had stumbled across the Hot Crazy Matrix (HCM) YouTube video and was struck by its popularity and media coverage it had attracted. It got me thinking about why it resonates with so many people,” explained study author Alyson Blanchard, a senior lecturer at Bishop Grosseteste University.

“I’m an evolutionary psychologist and my earlier research had examined adaptive characteristics of psychopathic traits and how they might be appealing in a romantic partner. That is, the familiar notion of women being attracted to ‘bad boys’ even though it is evident that the boy is bad for them!”

“The Hot Crazy Matrix basically asks whether the same could be said for men being attracted to ‘crazy women.’ The reason for the popularity of the HCM is because we have ourselves or known someone who has been in a turbulent relationship with someone who was emotionally unstable, and have been warned off of them by despairing friends and family who cannot understand why anyone would stay in the relationship,” Blanchard said.

“However, the upside of this instability is that these individuals might be exciting to be with in terms of sensation seeking and being impulsive. The relationship is like a roller coaster where the highs are very high and the lows are very low — this is why people probably stay in these types of relationships, because of the uncertainty and drama. The HCM therefore provided a framework for testing what we already know about mate preferences from evolutionary psychology but this time from a man’s point of view.”

In two studies, which included 525 English-speaking adults, participants were asked to evaluate the dating appeal of hypothetical individuals. The participants viewed a facial photograph of each target individual, along with a brief biography. The profiles varied in their level of facial attractiveness, psychopathic and borderline personality traits, and wealth.

For example, those high in psychopathic and borderline personality trait were described as someone who liked to “flout the rules” and was “quite intense” and “a bit wild – driving fast and taking drugs.” They were also described as someone with a lot of “relationship dramas” who was “anxious” and “self-critical.”

In line with previous research, Blanchard and her colleagues found that personality traits and wealth status were the most important factors in predicting dating appeal among female participants. Women in the study tended to prefer partners who were high in wealth and low in psychopathic traits, even when they were rated as low in facial attractiveness.

“Women are more discerning when choosing a partner, likely because an unreliable partner would have adverse outcomes for her and her child. Previous research had been equivocal with regards to whether women are attracted to bad boys, and the findings from this study suggest they are not, at least in comparison to men who are less discerning. Again, from an evolutionary perspective we would expect this as men are not traditionally the primary caregiver and so the consequences are less severe in forming problematic relationships,” Blanchard said.

For men, attractiveness was the most important factor in predicting dating appeal. Men viewed physically attractive women who were high in borderline personality traits to be more appealing than women who were less physically attractive and low in borderline personality traits.

“What is so great about evolutionary psychology is that it reveals adaptive aspects of personality traits that are usually viewed negatively. The fact is that these types of personality traits continue to reside within the population so they must be appealing to someone, otherwise these traits would go extinct,” Blanchard told PsyPost.

“You might ask yourself, ‘why am I with this person when the relationship is so fraught?’ Well, in some contexts being emotionally unstable, impulsive and intense might work out better. For example, if you live in a hostile environment, creating intense relationships might be advantageous if you are a mother (as the primary caregiver) wanting to ensure that her partner commits to her and her child.”

“Even though it might only last in the short-term, it might also be sufficient for the initial crucial period of childrearing. In either case, whether you are the person attracted to the emotionally unstable individual, or perhaps identify with that individual, the take home message is that personality and behaviour is ultimately purposeful and should be considered equal rather than attributing positive or negative values to different traits,” Blanchard explained.

“Some would also argue that the word ‘crazy’ is stigmatising in describing a person. However, we are not talking about pathological diagnoses and the word is understood by the average person to refer to someone who is emotionally unstable. In any case, the HCM deserves investigation because it is real world phenomena. Psychological research should reach the everyday person in informing them about things that they are familiar with.”

“Furthermore, by providing an evolutionary psychological explanation for it we can remove negative evaluations of emotionally unstable people in understanding that their personality style is as fitness-affording as any other. In some cases, they even have the advantage,” Blanchard added.

The study, “Borderline personality traits in attractive women and wealthy low attractive men are relatively favoured by the opposite sex“, was authored by Alyson E. Blanchard, Thomas J. Dunn, and Alex Sumich.

Self-criticism in Communist states

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-criticism
Communist states:
	
It has been suggested that this article be merged into Self-criticism (Marxism–Leninism). (Discuss) Proposed since February 2020.
Main article: Self-criticism (Marxism)

The concept of self-criticism is a component of some Marxist schools of thought, primarily that of Marxism–Leninism, Stalinism, Maoism and Marxism–Leninism–Maoism. The concept was first introduced by Joseph Stalin in his 1925 work The Foundations of Leninism[23] and later expanded upon in his 1928 work Against Vulgarising the Slogan of Self-Criticism.[24] The Marxist concept of self-criticism is also present in the works of Mao Zedong, who was heavily influenced by Stalin, dedicating an entire chapter of The Little Red Book to the issue.

In some communist states, party members who had fallen out of favor with the nomenklatura were sometimes forced to undergo self-criticism sessions, producing either written or verbal statements detailing their ideological errors and affirming their renewed belief in the party line. However, self-criticism did not guarantee political rehabilitation and often offenders were still expelled from the party, or in some cases even executed.[citation needed]
East German factory wall newspaper "Criticism and Self-Criticism in Five-Year Plans"

In the Soviet Union, criticism and self-criticism were known as kritika i samokritika (Russian: критика и самокритика).

In the People's Republic of China, self-criticism—called ziwo pipan (自我批判) or jiǎntǎo (检讨)—is an important part of Maoist practice. Mandatory self-criticism as a part of political rehabilitation or prior to execution—common under Mao, ended by Deng Xiaoping and partially revived by Xi Jinping—is known as a struggle session in reference to class struggle.[citation needed]

Under the Khmer Rouge, self-criticism sessions were known as rien sot, meaning "religious education". In his memoir The Gate, François Bizot recalls observing the Khmer Rouge engaging in frequent self-criticism to reinforce group cohesion during his imprisonment in rural Cambodia in 1971:[25]

    Several evenings a week—every evening it didn't rain—the guards gathered for a collective confession. Douch (Kang Kek Iew) did not take part. I was a privileged witness to these circles, where they would sit on the ground under the direction of an elder. Military homilies alternated with simple, repetitive songs. "Comrades," began the eldest, "let us appraise the day that has passed, in order to correct our faults. We must cleanse ourselves of the repeated sins that accumulate and slow down our beloved revolution. Do not be surprised at this!"
    "I," said the first one, "should have replaced the rattan rod today, the one north of the first shelter, which we use to dry clothes. I have done nothing about it... on account of my laziness." The man presiding over the session nodded with a frown, though not severely, only meaning to show that he knew how hard it was to combat inertia, so natural in man when he is not sustained by revolutionary convictions. He passed wordlessly onto the next man, indicating who this should be by pursing his lips in his direction.

French Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser wrote "Essays in Self-Criticism" focused on the issue of ideologically correcting ideas expressed in his prior works, most prominently For Marx and Reading Capital.

What is Self-Criticism?
Liya Panayotova, Psychologist, liyap.com19.9K reads
3-4 minutes

A teacher mentally scolds himself for being too hard on a student, “Why do I always do this? That poor child looks so sullen and all because of me."

A lawyer loses a case and despite having won many others in the past, she tells herself, “I’m good for nothing. I couldn’t win a simple case. I shouldn’t have become a lawyer, I am not fit for the job.”

The food is saltier than it should, be causing the husband and father to question his culinary skills, “Gah, I have done it again. Why can’t I ever get it right? My wife will hate me for this.”

Do these examples sound familiar? Do you have a similar commentary running in your head? If so, you may be prone to self-criticism.

Being Self-Critical

Self-criticism refers to the behavior of pointing out one’s own perceived flaws. It could be directed towards various aspects of the self, be it physical appearance, behavior, inner thoughts and emotions, personality or intellectual attributes. Failing at something that is important to us, whether it is a relationship, school or work, can be painful. Most of these experiences jolt us, threatening the very core of who we think we are and who we aspire to be.
Protective Strategies

Failure makes us turn to self-protective strategies. These include:

    Rationalizing what happened, in order to place ourselves in a positive light

    Blaming another or discounting the importance of the event itself.

These make us feel better in the short term but overall, they are less likely to help us improve or avoid repeating these mistakes in the future.

Research shows that those with an overly inflated view of their performance showed decrements in subsequent motivation and performance as compared to people who viewed themselves more realistically. These people believe they have reached perfection, and hence stop putting efforts into improving themselves.
Confronting Imperfections

Although easier said than done, taking an honest view of oneself is important, in order to strive for betterment. Confronting one’s faults and imperfections can be overwhelming and may lead to feelings of despair and hopelessness.
Self-Criticism Can Be Detrimental

In order to take responsibility for our actions and make an effort to improve, we might get carried away and blame ourselves far more than our share and pull ourselves down. Research reports self-criticism leads to an increase in procrastination and impedes goal-progression. Feeling worthless and incompetent drives away any likelihood of putting a better effort next time.

Self-criticism is both powerful and dangerous. In moderation, it works just right to stimulate improvement, but too much can ruin your self-confidence.

Sheitel - Wikipedia
3 minutes

Sheitel (Yiddish: שייטל‎, sheytl m.sg.; שייטלעך, sheytlekh m.pl. or שייטלען, sheytlen m.pl.; Hebrew: פאה נוכרית‎) is a wig or half-wig worn by some Orthodox Jewish married women in order to conform with the requirement of Jewish law to cover their hair. Some Hasidic groups encourage sheitels, while others avoid them.[1]
Name[edit source]

The related term in Hebrew is pei'ah (פאה).[2]
Purpose[edit source]

This practice is part of the modesty-related dress standard called tzniut. Traditional sheitels are secured by elastic caps and are often designed with heavy bangs to obscure the hairline of their wearers. More modern designed lace-front wigs with realistic hairlines or real hair are growing in popularity.[2]
Acceptability[edit source]

In 2004, there was a degree of controversy over natural hair sheitels procured from India. It was discovered that the hair used for the production of these wigs was taken from a Hindu temple. According to Jewish law, one cannot derive benefit from anything used in what Judaism considers to be idolatry. The controversy ceased when it became clear that the hair was neither worshiped nor offered as a sacrifice to the deity, but shaven as a rite of purification, thus excluding it from the category of forbidden items.[dubious – discuss][failed verification][3]

Today, many wigs used by Jewish women come with a hechsher (kosher certification), indicating that they are not made with hair originating from rituals deemed to be idolatrous.[4]

In many Hasidic groups, sheitels are avoided, as they can give the impression that the wearer's head is uncovered. In other Hasidic groups, women wear some type of covering over the sheitel to avoid this misconception, for example a scarf or a hat. Married Sephardi and National Religious women do not wear wigs, because their rabbis believe that wigs are insufficiently modest, and that other head coverings, such as a scarf (tichel), a snood, or a hat, are more suitable. In stark contrast, the Menachem Mendel Schneerson encouraged all married Jewish women to wear sheitels, even though we see in Torat Menachem he writes that in fact, "if she can cover her hair with a scarf, it is definitely good if she would do so, but in reality we know that this doesn't happen."[1][5]

Idolatry in Judaism - Wikipedia
5-6 minutes

Idolatry in Judaism is prohibited. Judaism holds that idolatry is not limited to the worship of an idol itself, but also worship involving any artistic representations of God. In addition it is forbidden to derive benefit (hana'ah) from anything dedicated to idolatry. However, aniconism in Judaism has not prevented traditions of Jewish art at various periods.[citation needed]
Judaism's view of idolatry[edit source]

Judaism had historically stood out from other faiths in the ancient world because of its strict monotheism.[1] To Judaism idolatry is the ultimate betrayal of God's relationship with humanity. It is also the ultimate metaphysical error. Idolatry was also reckoned as avodah zerah (″foreign worship″). Jewish identity in the ancient Greek and Roman civilisations was shaped by the rejection of idolatry. The strict avoidance of idolatry affected Jewish daily life in terms of cuisine, coinage, socialisations and participation in games. Jewish law's strict prohibition of idolatry meant that Jewish movements through areas containing images were inhibited. By the first century CE Jews had responded to the idolatry of non-Jews through satire and polemics. Jewish writers used the works of their own scriptures as well as the works of Greek philosophers to denounce idolatry.[2] While Judaism has never sought to impose the faith on non-Jews, it does require the elimination of idolatry from the world. According to Maimonides, Moses was ordered to compel all the world to accept the Noahide laws and end idolatry.[3] The question of idolatry was a sensitive one, because idolatrous actions had brought destruction in the wilderness, according to the scriptures.[4]

While Jews in general abhorred idolatry, some members of the Diaspora did engage in idolatrous actions. Such Jews often objectified God, visited and worshiped in pagan temples and abandoned their Jewish heritage. Some Jews differed with others on what defined an idolatrous practice.[5] According to Atapanus and Pseudo-Aristeas some Jews were idolatrous on the cognitive level. Evidence from papyri and inscriptions also indicate that some Jews did not object to idolatry even while they clung on to their Jewish heritage.[6]

The Mishnah and Talmud have defined idolatry. It includes worshiping an idol in the manner of its worshipers. This is called ″customary worship″. Another criterion is worshiping the idol with acts which are for worshiping God in the Temple. These include animal sacrifice, incense burning and sprinkling blood. Performing one of these acts means the performer is dubbed an idolater. The third criterion of idolatry is prostration. This includes bowing down with at least the head or knees on the ground. Acts such as kissing, embracing and honoring are forbidden but are not considered to come under idolatry. The performer of such an act does not receive capital punishment unlike the idolater in Jewish law.[7] Tractate Avodah Zarah of the Talmud governs Jewish interactions with idolaters. It places certain restrictions on business dealings with idolaters for the days in proximity to idolatrous festivals. It was forbidden to provide or take any benefit from idolatrous actions. These regulations had a strong impact on Jewish business dealings with Christians during the Middle Ages. Because Jews regarded Christians as idolaters because of Christian doctrines such as the trinity, Jews would not do business dealings with Christians on Sundays. Business dealings with Muslims were not affected because Jews regarded the Muslims as pure monotheists like themselves.[8]

Toxic self-criticism VS the art of constructive self-criticism
Tony TCTN⚡️
Tony TCTN⚡️
Jan 21, 2019 · 4 min read

Toxic self-criticism can leave you paralyzed — not letting you become the strongest version of youself. Remember that.

We all have the little voice in our head telling us what we’ve done wrong. But what happens when that voice starts giving you courage, rather than pushing you down? I want to explore that today.

There’s a big difference between constructive self-criticism and toxic self-criticism. I’ve purposely chosen a lion for the picture of this article because it represents courage and power. That’s exactly what you get from constructive self-criticism.
What is toxic self-criticism?

It’s the little voice in your head chattering away in your head, filling you with self-doubt. Perhaps it’s saying “You’re not good enough”, “You’ll never be able to do this” etc. Kelly McGonigal at Standford University has found that self-criticism is far more destructive than helpful. But I would beg to differ. If you can channel those toxic thoughts into constructive self-criticism, it’ll make a huge difference. I want to help you overcome it, and here’s how:

    Pay attention to your thoughts. We’re so used to hearing our own thoughts that it’s easy to become oblivious to the message we’re sending ourselves. Pay close attention and you may discover that you have toxic thoughts about yourself. Don’t let them drag you down.
    Replace negative thoughts with realistic statements. Those negative, toxic thoughts are not always true, are they? “You’re not good enough”, that statement alone is not true. The fact that you are here, reading articles about self-improvement on this platform, constantly trying to become the best version of yourself all the evidence you need that those statements are false and so very toxic for you.
    Train your brain to think differently. Your mind can be your best friend or your worst enemy. It’s important to train it well. Always listen to your thoughts and channel them the right way. The next question I want to answer is:

What is constructive self-criticism?

Imagine the two ways you criticize yourself as two figures standing on your shoulders. One is bad! Very, very bad. The other one though is really good for you. Helps you make the right choices and the tough choices. That one is constructive self-criticism. And I want to help you understand how to listen to it.

    Only criticize specific, changable behaviors. People who blame themselves for negative events are more likely to be depressed. Constructive self-criticism, by contrast, involves a more optimistic approach to said negative events. With a focus on specific, modifiable areas in need of improvement. For example — You stayed up late watching netflix, while you could’ve been working on a project. Rather than punishing yourself by feeling guilty, set up a time limit for the next time you start binge-watching your favorite TV show.
    If it’s out of your control, it’s pointless punishing yourself for it. I already talked about the art of double stress in another article (How to stop overthinking and turn it into something positive). If you can’t change the circumstances surrounding a negative event, it’s absolutely pointless even thinking about it. It will leave you with stress you don’t deserve (the worst kind of stress). All you have to do is just let it go. Can you do something to fix it? If the answer is yes, then you’ll fix the problem and all will be well. No need to think about it and stress yourself out with negative thoughts. If the answer is no, then it’s exactly the same. No need to think about it and stress yourself out with negative thoughts. If it’s within your control — you’ll fix it. If it’s not — you won’t. Pushing yourself down with negative self talk will only hurt you in the long run.
    Practice self-compassionate self-criticism. Self-compassion is like a parachute that allows you to glide safely down into the parts of yourself you’re afraid to look at. It means saying — Yes, I messed up, but it doesn’t make me a horrible person. This makes me a person who has strengths and weaknesses and room to improve. If you truly believe this, taking a closer look at those weaknesses won’t be scary, it’ll be necessary.

Work every single day to become the strongest version of yourself.

Growing stronger is about accumulating wisdom, learning from your mistakes and inspiring others to become the strongest version of themselves too.

Abstract

Men and women reliably differ on the importance of certain criteria when considering romantic relationships. From an evolutionary perspective that explains sex differences in mating effort and parental investment, men should prioritise attractiveness and women, wealth. Personality traits also signal important information about relationship potential with those of the dark triad facilitating short-term relationships. However, how the vulnerable dark triad traits of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and secondary psychopathyfunction in relationships remains relatively unexplored. Even though interpersonally tempestuous, individuals high in these traits might be alluring in that they offer a thrilling relationship for the short-term, so long as they are also physically appealing. Across two studies, we examined sex differences in partner preference judged on attractiveness in relation to BPD and secondary psychopathy across short- and long-term relationship contexts. Men were willing to engage in relationships with attractive women high in BPD traits, while women compensated low attractiveness for wealth in long-term dating, and did not desire secondary psychopathy in any relationship. Results show that women are more astute in mate preference, avoiding troublesome or financially challenged men who are time and economically costly, and men more readily engage in potentially turbulent relationships.

Formal Logical Fallacy: Affirmative conclusion from a negative premise
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_conclusion_from_a_negative_premise

Affirmative conclusion from a negative premise (illicit negative) is a formal fallacy that is committed when a categorical syllogism has a positive conclusion and one or two negative premises.

 
- No fish are dogs, and no dogs can fly, therefore all fish can fly.
- We don't read that trash. People who read that trash don't appreciate real literature. Therefore, we appreciate real literature.
- We don't read Chetan Bhagat. People who read Chetan Bhagat don't appreciate real literature. Therefore, we appreciate real literature.

Was Rudyard Kipling an Imperialist?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Man%27s_Burden

The title, the subject, and the themes of "The White Man's Burden" provoke accusations of advocacy of the Eurocentric racism inherent to the idea that, by way of industrialisation, the Western world delivers civilisation to the non-white peoples of the world.[6][7][8]

He rewrote "The White Man's Burden" to encourage American colonisation and annexation of the Philippine Islands, a Pacific Ocean archipelago conquered in the three-month Spanish–American War (1898).[1] As a poet of imperialism, Kipling exhorts the American reader and listener to take up the enterprise of empire, yet warns about the personal costs faced, endured, and paid in building an empire;[1] nonetheless, American imperialists understood the phrase The white man's burden to justify imperial conquest as a mission-of-civilisation that is ideologically related to the continental-expansion philosophy of Manifest Destiny of the early 19th century.[

Monkey patching in JavaScript - Aurelio De Rosa blog
Aurelio De Rosa
7-9 minutes

When working on a project, we often use libraries that implement methods that aren’t built-in in the programming language in use. These libraries don’t cover all the possibilities, so they might lack one or more crucial features we need. When this happens, we have two choices: the first is to create our own module that implements the methods we need, the second is to add those methods to the library itself or to the built-in objects of the language. The latter approach is known as Monkey patching.

In this article, we’ll look at what Monkey patching is, what pros and cons it has, and also a couple of examples that employ this technique.
What is Monkey patching?

Monkey patching is a technique to add, modify, or suppress the default behavior of a piece of code at runtime without changing its original source code.

It has been extensively used in the past by libraries, such as MooTools, and developers to add methods that were missing in JavaScript. A well-known example is the endsWith() method, which has been introduced in ECMAScript 2015. Before this version, developers had to implement this method themselves. As mentioned before, there are a couple of ways to do that.

One possible approach is to create a Utility object that exposes a endsWith() method as shown below:

1

2

3

4

5
	

var Utility = {

   endsWith: function(string, suffix) {

      return string.indexOf(suffix, string.length - suffix.length) !== -1;

   }

};

With this code in place, the developer would call the method as follows:

1
	

var isSuffix = Utility.endsWith('hello world', 'ld');

Another approach is to Monkey patch the built-in String object to expose the method:

1

2

3
	

String.prototype.endsWith = function(suffix) {

   return this.indexOf(suffix, this.length - suffix.length) !== -1;

};

With this approach, the developer would call the method as follows:

1
	

var isSuffix = 'hello world'.endsWith('ld');

At first glance, the second version makes more sense because an endsWith() method logically belongs to a string. However, as we’ll discuss later, this approach can cause several problems.

The endsWith() example demonstrates how to use Monkey patching to add a method to a built-in object, but Monkey patching can be used also to change the behavior of a method.
Using Monkey patching to change a method

Many developers tend to use console.log() when debugging their code. This technique shouldn’t be used by professional developers, as they should adopt breakpoints and watch variables. For the sake of this discussion, let’s pretend that console.log() is the best way to debug code and that you’re using it to inspect the value of a variable at different points in time. Everything is working well, but you realize that it would be nice if in addition to printing the value of the variable, the method printed the date at which the method was called. To achieve this goal, you can employ Monkey patching as follows:

1

2

3

4

5

6
	

var log = console.log;

console.log = function() {

   log.apply(console, [(new Date()).toString()].concat(arguments));

};

In this code, we first save the original console.log() method in a variable named log. This allows us to reuse the original method whenever we want, as we’ll see in a moment. Then, we assign an anonymous function to the property log of the console. In other words, we override the original console.log() method. Inside the anonymous function we invoke the original console.log() method, stored in the log variable, by passing to it all the arguments passed to the anonymous function (through the use of arguments) prepended by the current date and time.

Now that we’ve discussed what Monkey patching is and how to employ it, let’s examine why it’s usually considered a bad practice and when it can be helpful.
The cons of Monkey patching

Monkey patching is often considered a dangerous technique. Not too long ago, the use of Monkey patching has caused the rename of ECMAScript’s 2015 method String.prototype.contains() to String.prototype.includes(). This change was necessary to avoid that websites using MooTools, which adds a contains() method to String.prototype, were broken due to introduction of the ECMAScript version of the method. In particular, the problem was that the contains() method added by MooTools and the contains() method added in ECMAScript 2015 were incompatible. If you want to know more about this topic, you can read the include() method page on MDN.

The lesson to learn here is that Monkey patching, especially when used on a built-in object, can interfere with the evolution of the language. This rule can also be extended to any code that you don’t own, such a library or a framework. Another point to keep in mind when Monkey patching code you don’t own is that you can never be sure the behavior of the methods you patch. In fact, in the same way you have changed a method, another developer in another part of the software might have done the same. So, chances there are that the two versions will conflict causing issues in the software.
When to use Monkey patching

One case where Monkey patching is a good choice is when it’s used to polyfill methods that are already part of the ECMAScript standard and that are not supported by every browser. This is a safe choice because the method has already been standardized, thus you know its signature and its exact behavior. In addition, by using a defensive technique, you can ensure that you add your own version only if the built-in one isn’t available. To understand how you can safely employ Monkey patching, let’s see an example.

As mentioned before, one of the methods introduced in ECMAScript 2015 is String.prototype.includes(). It returns true if one string is contained within another; false otherwise. Its signature is the following:

1
	

String.prototype.includes(searchString[, position])

searchString is the string to be searched and position is an optional parameter to specify the position at which to begin searching for searchString. The default value of position is 0.

To support browsers that don’t expose the String.prototype.includes() method, we can employ Monkey patching as follows:

1

2

3

4

5

6

7

8

9

10

11

12
	

String.prototype.includes = function(searchString, position) {

   'use strict';

   if (typeof position !== 'number') {

      start = 0;

   }

   if (position + searchString.length > this.length) {

      return false;

   } else {

      return this.indexOf(searchString, position) !== -1;

   }

};

If we use the previous snippet as is, we also override the native implementation of String.prototype.includes() in browsers that support the method natively. To avoid this effect, we should only add the function if it doesn’t exist in the browser. This can be achieved in two, equivalent ways.

The first solution is to use an if:

1

2

3

4

5
	

if (!String.prototype.includes) {

   String.prototype.includes = function(searchString, position) {

   };

}

Another approach is to use the || (OR) logical operator:

1

2

3
	

String.prototype.includes = String.prototype.includes || function(searchString, position) {

};
Conclusions

In this article, I’ve covered what Monkey patching is and how it can be used in JavaScript. As we’ve discussed, in most of the cases Monkey patching is dangerous and can cause issues, therefore you should avoid it. We’ve also seen a case where Monkey patching a JavaScript built-in object is a good choice: polyfills. Using Monkey patching in conjunction with a defensive technique to polyfill a method that is already part of the ECMAScript standard but it isn’t supported by some browsers is a great way to avoid creating branches in your code. It also avoids the risk of conflicting with other parts of your software or future features the language.

Advantages of having a YOUNG / TEEN BRIDE for better married life

Quite often you stumble across that special girl in your life and the feel of special is instantaneous . So its natural you ask this question in due process , " Will you marry me ?!" . Now hold on , just read below points Feminist era has lots of selfish girls around , so the answer is also likely be twisted and confusing

I bet most of the answer would be like , " I am not ready for it !" , and the girl will cunningly give reason that her education is not yet complete or so want to delay or yet not ready for a SERIOUS relationship

*Now excluding the girls who is gonna become a nobel laureate or famous scientist or a billionaire post education , rest mostly probably will be hogging and straying with campus with multiple boys for a candid sweet candy short term romances .

*Now marriage means committed to one partner hence it lessens their sexual adventures , and it suppresses their options for promiscuity . So such girls will hate it , they will give reasons about not being owned by anyone even after marriage

*The prime of a girl lies in her teen years , and their apatite is very strong in early years of blossom . So this has to be harnessed for a life time commitment rather than wasting it on random partners acquiring viral infections .

*So girls vouching for late marriages and loosing virginity at colleges /work places have nothing to offer for their future husbands . They certainly make unfaithful partners due to the very fact the innocence is just not there . Its beyond the tissue and strikes against modesty and chastity

*So later when they marry they already got acquainted with multiple men and the grooms destiny hangs in balance . She keeps her men as stand by , in case any stiff with husband to bank on . Likely upon divorce they gulp fat alimony from biased / anti men dv laws , and continue affair with previous boy friends . Some men marry such divorcees as if they r doing favour or be a part of this extortion

* So its simple , only entertain the educated / working girl above 20 years if she is well earning in a reputed organisation and is serious to work after marriage . Rest most of girls just TRADE their degrees to get well earning husband , so that they can be house wife aka gold digger . In present scenario with advent of Fb/ what's app most girls at a colleges / work places are canvassing with multiple affairs

*So its simple . Pick a girl very young ( mostly in her teen years ) , marry her , and then groom her to be ideal wife . Cut off her unnecessary social life and empower her with home maker values . And if you want a working wife , get a girl already in a reputed post and serious about her profession .

* Just avoid girls who completed her education and fishing for prospective grooms . Or in a moderate post in a moderate company . Her income will not help you considerably moreover it will create other visceral problems in your marital life . If any girl says no for your advances and she is not up for it , this means she just want to stray and once her apatite or looks will diminish she will go for marriage as she is out of options. Just ignore such species

History of Disco Music
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-MDun9lyDk
When Disco Ruled The World (BBC 2002)


1970s - Britain was dealing with union strikes and what not. New kind of music was emerging from Gay / Latin / Black American circle. The first ever "DISCO" hit was "Rock you baby" by Geroge McCrae.

- George McCrae - Recorded Rock You Baby
- From his first recording only two copies were sold, which he himself had bought. He thought, it was his last chance at singing. "Rock you baby" became No.1 in 51 countries. It was just everywhere [United States, Japan, Phillipines, Brazil and South America, Canada, Bangkok and all of Africa, Australlia, New Zealand]

- Disco was here, but Disc Jockeys had their work cut out. The records only lasted 3 minutes and mixing was still something you did with egg whites (with *) chef. <some DJ says>, We were not allowed to mix. You had to talk and the audience did not dance unless you spoke, so you have to read line and go "Hi, that was George McCrae and Rock your Baby". DJs were paid not just to play records. They were paid there to talk & talk, enteratain and entice the audience. <read more on seg-waying commercially>

- But everything's bigger in America. New US (AX) was pioneering King size Extra length disco records. Lurie Caine <or Gloria Gaynor> plays a major role here.

Gloria Gaynor - Never can Say Good Bye: It was the very first album to actually seg-way three tracks together commercially. She was a Disc Jokey's dream. Audience actually wanted to hear the whole album. Gloria Gaynor says, The album was very different because it was the first album done with non-stop play, so, with all songs seg-wayed into one-another, all pretty much the same beat, very much like the DJs mix records today. Tom Moulton, Disco Producer says, I played it and it was like 90 minutes long and everybody just looked at me and I said "What do you think?", Gloria said, "I don't sing much", her ego was hurt because there was so much music and she began questioning if there is so much instruments, then why record with a musician. Tom Moulton told her, Gloria, I guess you've to learn a few steps. Gloria, thought, then I'm like a dancer. I thought it's great. DJs really loved it. They never had heard anything like that before. Pete Waterman (DJ) says, the record was so great that you can go have sex and come back and it'd still be playing.
Summary: While Pete's knees were trembling, Gloria Gaynor became the 'Crowned Queen of Disco'

German Scene: There was a woman who knew ways of making you dance. Producer Giorgio Moroder was the man behind the new sexy sound of Donna Summers first hit.

Giorgio Moroder says, when we played it, there were a lot of people in the studio, her husband, the technician, some musician, and she just didn't feel like she'd have a good performance. So, basically, I shoo'ed everybody out, dimmed the lights, so, she couldn't see me and I could barely see her and that's when she did it [Love to love you baby].

This song definitely shaped sexuality. She starts groaning and that's really getting into the tune. You'll never know what it's done to you, but you will like it. It was filthy, wasn't that? When you get that sort of innuendo so full in your face, you kinda enjoy it, you say, I don't know, I'm coping with you at the minute. Please woman, just stand back, sing on the back foot. There's something bad, something very cool, something you'd have in your private moment you put in your school diary or vibrate<something something>. "What kinda girl you are". 

Before Donna, he had a lot of success in Electronic Music in the UK, with songs like, "Son of my father" with <Tickle Tips>. It was the beginning of a great friendship between sythesizers and me. We created a new start, we created a new genre with "I feel love". Suddenly, the word "DISCO" was born.

Stuart Maconie (Music Journalist) asys, All part of the song was robotic, so electronic, and only human part was the voice "I feel love" (Donna) and every kid will just go running. It's one of the most important records ever made. There were plenty of experiments before, but it was the first time when sequencers in Synthesizers with that robotic and repeatative way to make pop.

Dale Winton(DJ) says, He was like the German Version of KC. So, there were two ground swells of "New Music" coming along. Giorgio and KC kinda had more soul to it, where as Donna Summers was very electronic. Disco and sex went hand-in-hand anyway. One of the big disco hits was "More More More by Andrea Chi", Andrea Chi who was a bonafide Porn actress. "More More More, How do you like it, How do you like it".

Tom Moulton says, It never once dawned on me what she(Andrea Chi) was. When I heard it for the first time "More more more how do you like it", I thought she was talking about the music. Andrea True says, the soft "falsetto" just seemed right, it had that (vibe), I'm next to your ear, on your pillow. [falsetto
/fɔːlˈsɛtəʊ,fɒlˈsɛtəʊ/, noun: falsetto; plural noun: falsettos, is a method of voice production used by male singers, especially tenors, to sing notes higher than their normal range]. 

John-Manuel Andriote(Disco Author) says Donna Summers was marketed as the "First Lady of Lust" in the '78s. It was very overt, very conscious of the erotic aspect of the Disco and Dance Music and use that to sell records and it worked.

Tina Charles "Loving to love" says, Because I'd been a sessions singer for so long, I suppose I just thought, this is another song that will probably die without trace and how I was proven wrong.
It shot straight to the top of the charts.

"You to me are every thing" by "The Real Thing":


The Bees'Gees (Be Jeez), from Manchester to Massachusets, the world agreed, BeesGees' falsetto proved to be a massive hit that sold 83 million records. This was the Lynch Pin for their career. Trinny Woodall & Susannah Constantine (Fashion Journalists) say, Saturday Night Fever was the first time when a man had openly groomed himself. Disco was Saturday night fever and the movie, Saturday Night Fever became the Disco. And the "Walk", o'course the walk, you know everybody had kinda perfected that seriously cool walk. Every young man wanted to be in Travolta's shoes. Only one was, Jeff Zinn, Travolta Stand-In and he says, "I actually heard about the casting of the stand-in, through a friend of mine, she said, they are looking for a Travolta stand-in, you should submit yourself for that and as it happened, I was the right height, hair color, weight, I had the right physical requirements so I got the job. The very opening scene where you see the shoes are kicking the lens, those are my feet. There is shot of him swinging the paint can, thats me, thats my hand. When you see him hold his boot up to the window to copare to the shoes in the window, those are my feet.". Deney Terrio (Dance Teacher) taught travolta the dance moves - Splits, Knee drops, and Points, says "We went 5 months of training, pre-production and I took him out to night clubs and I told him, you see the girls, there will be 5 or 6 girls standing around or be at the table, when you start dancing, upto par, they will come ask you to dance. And by the end of the 5 months, he'd have long lines waiting for the girls to ask him to dance". John Badham (Director, Saturday Night Fever) says, "Travolta was terrified at this and he looked at it and said, I'll never be able to do that. How can I leap in the air and touch my toes with my fingers in the air, how can I do those Russian squats, and he was going to quit the movie." Emma Forbes (TV Presenter) says, he was "sex on legs" in that film.

YMCA: A song by American disco group Village People, representing American Young men, stereotyped. The song was written by Jacques Morali (also the record's producer). It was on #2 on Bill Boards right after "Le Freak" by Chic and "Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?" by Rod Stewart. In 2020, "Y.M.C.A" was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".[7][8] In its official press release, the Library noted that "back in its heyday, 'Y.M.C.A.' was a hit around the world, going to No. 1 on the charts in over 15 countries, and its ongoing popularity is evidence that, despite the naysayers, disco has never truly died." 

Taken at face value, the song's lyrics extol the virtues of the Young Men's Christian Association. However, in the gay culture from which the Village People stemmed, the song was implicitly understood as celebrating YMCA's reputation as a popular cruising and hookup spot, particularly for the younger men to whom it was addressed.[14] The initial goal of Village People producers Morali and Belolo was to attract disco's gay audience by featuring popular gay fantasy in their music.[15] Although co-creator Morali was gay and the group was initially intended to target gay men, the group became more popular and more mainstream over time.

The Village People, then quit new york and headed for hollywood. It was (about) to prove a low point for Disco and the movies. The movie was expected to flop. Though, The Village People wrote "You can't stop the music", somebody did stop the music and with that, ended the era of Disco music.

Nile Rodgers, (Chic), says -- "What was really upsetting and heart breaking to me, is that, I looked upon Disco music as some of the most politically powerful music that ever happened to American culture because even though in the '60s you could talk about Women's liberation, We could talk about the gay movement, and civil rights movement and in the '70s it played itself out in pop culture and was big" 

The Chicago burn event looked nothing less than a Nazi book burn. Some people think that there was a real element of Homophobia and Racism and sexism in this movement.

Gloria Gaynor concludes, "I think Disco has not died. It has just changed names to protect the innocent."

By 1979, the inevitable Disco backlash had arrived. Clothed agitators and rock fans converged on a baseball stadium in Chicago and under the banner of "Disco Sucks" stormed the pitch, blew up effigies and burned records.

Beschrijving:
The disco era, long dismissed as a time of hedonistic excess, has been gravely misunderstood. Revisionist historians now argue the era was in fact an important time of protest: liberating gays, blacks and women. THE SECRET DISCO REVOLUTION juxtaposes disco revisionists against revealing new interviews with the era's biggest stars: Gloria Gaynor (I Will Survive), Village People (YMCA, In The Navy), Robert "Kool" Bell from Kool and the Gang, and Harry Wayne "K.C." Casey - KC and the Sunshine Band.

As you shimmy through the world of disco, you start to believe in its subversive nature. Finding its home in dark nightclubs where class, gender, race and sexual boundaries disappeared completely, early disco was the music that brought people together – all without the music industry's hegemony over the radio and Billboard charts.

As Secret Disco Revolution often reminds us, the kings and queens of the era rarely saw the political statement they were making, and it seems with the Village People, their fans didn't either. But change was happening all the same, and you can't help but respect disco's masterminds – whoever they were – for coming up with such a clever plan.

Woman behind 'French #MeToo' found guilty of defaming media executive
Angelique Chrisafis
6-8 minutes

A woman who launched a French version of the #MeToo campaign to expose abusive male behaviour has been found guilty of defaming a media executive she accused of making lewd and sexist remarks.

Sandra Muller said Eric Brion had humiliated her with sexual remarks at a function in Cannes in 2012. She was ordered to pay €15,000 in damages to the executive and €5,000 in legal fees, and was also told to delete a tweet about him and publish the statements issued by the court on her Twitter account and in two press outlets.

Muller, a French journalist based in the US, vowed to appeal. She called the verdict a “backwards step” against the force of an “amazing movement” and said women must “continue the fight”. Her lawyer, Francis Szpiner, said the verdict was out of keeping with current times and a “regression”.

Muller started a viral hashtag in French in October 2017 called #balancetonporc (“expose your pig”), which called on French women to name and shame men in an echo of the #MeToo movement that began in response to allegations that toppled the film producer Harvey Weinstein.

In a Twitter post, Muller had quoted Brion as saying: “You have big breasts. You are my type of woman. I will make you orgasm all night.”

Brion, a media consultant and former head of the TV channel Equidia, acknowledged making inappropriate remarks for which he had apologised by text message the next day. But he sued for defamation, claiming Muller’s post wrongly portrayed him as a sex offender and that the publicity around the incident had ruined his career.

When the hearing opened in May, Brion’s legal team defended his “right to flirt”. Muller defended her right to freedom of expression and said her tweet meant sexist insults would be taken seriously.

Her post led to an outpouring of tales of harassment and assault, which were hailed as helping to confront a culture of permissiveness in France towards unwanted advances.

In a column in Le Monde in 2017, Brion admitted making “inappropriate remarks” to Muller at a cocktail party.

He wrote: “Effectively I did make misplaced comments to Sandra Muller during a drunken cocktail party very late one night, but only once. I liked her. I told her so, heavy-handedly. And only once, I must point out. I don’t want to exonerate myself from my boorishness at the time. I reiterate my apologies.”

But he accused Muller of “deliberately creating ambiguity about what happened” by linking it to the response to the Weinstein affair.

Brion learned of the guilty verdict with a “certain degree of relief and reaffirms he has never harassed Sandra Muller”, his lawyer, Nicolas Benoit, told AFP.

Earlier this year, Denis Baupin, a Green MP and former vice-president of the lower house in the French parliament, lost a defamation suit against six women who accused him of sexual harassment and four journalists who had reported the allegations. His decision to sue for defamation was seen as a backlash against the #MeToo movement in France.
With those in power failing us …

… at this historic moment, we demand better. From the coronavirus pandemic and police brutality to the marginalisation of minority communities around the world, leadership is broken. Devoid of the humility and inclusivity we so desperately need, and given to narcissism, leaders are gambling with public health, safety and the future of younger generations. They unapologetically prioritise serving themselves over the people they were elected to serve. We have to make them raise their game.

That’s what the Guardian’s here for. As an open, independent news organisation we investigate, interrogate and expose the incompetence and indifference of those in power, without fear. Our journalism is free from political and commercial bias – this makes us different. We can give a voice to the oppressed and neglected, and stand in solidarity with those who are calling for a fairer future. With your help we can bring about improvement.

You’ve read 22 articles in the last six months. And you’re not alone; millions are flocking to the Guardian for quality news every day. We believe everyone deserves access to information that is fact-checked, and analysis that has authority and integrity. That’s why, unlike many others, we made a choice: to keep Guardian reporting open for all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford to pay.

We’re determined to provide journalism that helps each of us better understand the world, and take actions that challenge, unite, and inspire change – in times of crisis and beyond. Our work would not be possible without our readers, who now support our work from 180 countries around the world.

But news organisations are facing an existential threat. With advertising revenues plummeting, the Guardian risks losing a major source of its funding. More than ever before, we’re reliant on financial support from readers to fill the gap. Your support keeps us independent, open, and means we can maintain our high quality reporting – investigating, disentangling and interrogating.

Every reader contribution, however big or small, is so valuable for our future. Support the Guardian from as little as $1 – and it only takes a minute. Thank you.

Remind me in September

Bois Locker Room News: ‘Sidharth’ is actually a girl; fake account used to suggest plan for sexual assault | Delhi News - Times of India
TNN | Updated: May 11, 2020, 14:54 IST
3 minutes

NEW DELHI: 

It was a girl who had created a fake profile on Snapchat and messaged a fellow classmate, talking about her own sexual assault, investigations in the #BoisLocker-Room chats have revealed. The boy in the conversation had refused to participate in the sexual assault and stopped replying as well.
Police said a screenshot of the Snapchat conversation initially went viral, along with chats from the locker room, but it turned out that the two conversations were not related. Their probe has revealed that a girl had created a fake account by the name of Sidharth on Snapchat and chatted with a male classmate about planning a sexual assault, apparently to see how he reacted.

DCP (cyber cell) Anyesh Roy said, “There were many screenshots which went viral and among them was a screenshot of a one-to-one snapchat conversation, where a person identified as ‘Sidharth’ is suggesting a plan of aggravated sexual assault of a girl to the other boy. The alleged conversation was actually between a girl who had created a fake account in the name of ‘Sidharth’ and sent the messages to the boy, she suggested a plan to sexually assault herself.”
Investigating officials revealed that the girl and the boy live in the same vicinity.
Locker-room chats: Girl wanted to ‘test character’
The girl was examined by police and revealed that she sent the messages to check the reaction of the boy and the “strength of his character”.
The boy subsequently shared the screenshot of the Snapchat conversation with his friends, including the girl who had spoken to him using the fake account.
“Later on, someone posted the screenshot on their Instagram story and it went viral,” said Roy.



It was initially believed that the Snapchat conversation was a conversation between boys who were a part of the #BoisLockerRoom. It turns out that none of the 27 boys identified so far were part of any conversation on Snapchat.
So far police have arrested the group administrator of the #BoisLockerRoom from Noida and apprehended a juvenile who was in the group. Of the 27 boys, 24 have been examined, two are out of reach and the details of one more are awaited.

Kulning is an ancient herding call that Swedish #woman have practiced for hundreds of years. But in recent decades, it’s been largely forgotten. In the video, Jonna Jinton portrays this tradition called Kulning, which has been going on since the Middle Ages. The high pitched song can span far distances. Every shepherd family once had its own call song, which was passed down from generation to generation. Although this technique is used very little today, it is still possible to hear it in some mountainous parts of Sweden and Norway.

You Are Accused Of Murder. Now What? [Criminal Trial Procedure in India: What Happens In Courts]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fpDAPWjLGo


I talk about police investigation, court trials, witness depositions, statutory bail, and a lot more. 
I use a hypothetical example of what will go on if you are accused of murder. 


Question from clients: You are accused of Murder, what happens now?
Alternatively: What happens when you accuse someone of Murder?

First and foremost, in all likliehood, the police will try to apprehend you. Obviously! They will try to put you under arrest, because it is a cognizable offence. Which means, the Police have the power to investigate the offense, and [since we are talking about murder], it's a non-bailable offense.

Non-bailable Meaning: Non-bailable means, the police doesn't have a right to release you on bail. You will be produced before a Magistrate. You will have to move an application for bail and only then if the court deems it fit (whether should you be released on bail).

Summary: If its a cognizable offense, it's a non-bailable offense.

The police will try to hunt you down as quickly as possible, so that they can enquire from you, ask you things which will help the police in identifying if you're actually the perpetrator or not. Assuming that you're arrested, the police will then, endeavor to collect the medical evidence, the eye witness testimony and every other relevant evidence which will aid the prosecution in getting the conviction against you.

Included in that and a big part of it, is collecting eye witness testimony. The police collect eye witness testimony under Section 161 of the CrPC (Criminal Procedure Code). This is important to understand as a layman that any testimony given by a witness to the police is not admissible as evidence by itself. The person who has given that statement (testimony) to the police must also come to court at a later stage at trial and testify and that statement given to the police is not going to help the prosecution in any sort of way
It is there only so that the police can compile its case and then submit it in the court of law.

It is however used by the Defense counsel to contradict the person who has come to court and given his testimony.

So if I go as a witness go to court and say that I saw "you" committed the murder and I give my statement under section 161 of the CrPC to the police and when the state calls me to testimonial stand to stand and give my testimony, I will give my version again and hopefully in the same line of thought that I gave to the police. Now, however, the defense counsel can and ideally should, use my earlier statement given to police and try to contradict me. So the defense counsel will ask, Mr. Agarwal, you said on that night, you saw the person stab the victim from the front. Now your testimony is, he did not stab him from the front, he stabbed him from the side. Which was correct? The earlier version or this version?

To which, I most likely will say, that the version that I gave in the court was the correct version and the police officer did not actually write down my statement properly. which is then used by the defense to show lacunae in the investigation process. And that will also be used against the investigation officer and confronted that the defense counsel will confront this statement to investigating officer and say that the allegation that we are saying "we are putting an allegation on you, the investigating officer that you did not correctly investigate into the matter and you wrote the 161 statement of the witness yourself. You did not actually bother to take down the statement verbatim of the prosecution witness."  

Apart from that, there will be a lot of medical evidence. All of this investigation processes that the police does earlier is compiled into, what is called a charge sheet and is submitted before the court. Now if it is a murder case, then there is a very good liklihood that the judge will not really need to think much about it and will issue summons to the accused person to "you", who is already in custody.


Mind you, the police will have a very very strong incentive to file the charge sheet within 90days of having arrested you. Otherwise, you have a mandatory right to be released on bail. This is called the law of statutory bail whether where a person who has been accused of an offense and  he has been arrested by the police, within 60 days of his arrest in minor offenses and within 90 days of his arrest in certain more grave cases, if the charge sheet is not filed, the person has a right to be released on bail as a matter of right.

So, ideally, in most cases, the police will file the chargesheet within 90 days because it is a murder, a grave offense. And once the chargesheet is filed, summons are issued to you, you're of course in police custody. So you're produced from the jail before the judge and then the judge reads out to the charge, there will be arguments on the charge, the judge will read out the charges against you, you will in-all likliehood plead "not guilty" and then the matter will proceed to trial where where all of these witnesses who already have been investigated, their statements taken down by the police, they will now be called one by one by the state and actually to give their eye witness testimony to what exactly happened. 

After that the statement of the accused under section 313 is recorded. It is very very crucial because every single thing which has come in evidence which the prosecution have said against the accused person, now all of that testimony will be put to the accused and the way it happens is - there will be a question answer format.

So the question that will be asked to the accused person is:  It has come in evidence against you that Mr. Ameesh Agarwal has deposed that he saw you stab the victim from the front / from the side (whatever the witness said in his testimony). So, Mr Agarwal has deposed that he saw you stabbing the victim straight up ahead. Then the question is: What do you have to say to that.

To which, ideally, again, the accused person should reply - It is incorrect and it is wrong. It is denied / it is incorrect.

And, then, after that the defense evidence, if you want to move any, if you want to show any witnesses who will come and testify, may be there is a plea of alibi, that you were actually some where else when puportedly the crime was comitted, or that you want to show that you had no motive to commit the crime or there is some other motive to falsely implicate you in the case, in those kind of situations, you will want to get a defense witness to come and testify to all those facts in your favor.


Now after that, the arguments happen and the matter concludes the judge will decide, whether you will be convicted or not. Another very crucial thing that is very very important in criminal cases especially, is the question of whether there is direct evidence or whether there is circumstantial evidence.

For example, in this case, we've discussed that Amish Agarwal saw you stabbing the victim in the chest or in the stomach or whatever it is. For example, if you, or the victim, his body is lying on the street and there is a knife and on the knife there is finger print of you and which are traced back to you and then there is perhaps there is a phone message, that you texted or it shows that you messaged the victim 'i will kill you', and there is perhaps there is also, some of the victims blood on your clothes, or may be on your shoes. So those are which are called circumstantial evidence. There is no


Definition:
Cognisable/Cognizable Offence: In India, crimes like rape, murder and theft are considered cognisable unlike crimes like public nuisance, hurt and mischief. Generally, cognisable offence means an offence in which a police officer has the authority to make an arrest without a warrant and to start an investigation with or without the permission of a court. The police can file a First Information Report (FIR) only for cognizable offences.

Existence of this classification: Cognisable offence and non-cognisable offence are classifications of crime used in the legal system of India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. Non-cognisable offences includes misbehavior, public annoyance etc.

If you are in a committed monogamous relationship, notice thirst-traps and acknowledge that you like what you see, but then keeeeeeeep on scrolling.

Being protective of your phone: Saving a crush's name in the phone under a fake name, setting it to “Do Not Disturb” and locking it, you’re just a little nervous about your partner seeing your phone, you know they’d take it the wrong way if a certain name popped up on your screen

Spending time with someone in a meaningful way and not telling your partner: f my husband had done that with another woman, I would have been furious, but I **convinced myself** it “wasn’t a big deal” because it didn’t go further.

The Real Reason Why Modern Movies Suck
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VI9RSlHqu-w

I'm with moustache guy. Today's movies are created to be financially safe and  results in us getting simple-themed trash. I find I cannot get emotionally invested in modern cinema with their constantly repetitive and predictable structure. My formula for watching a movie is simple - if it has less than 3 moustaches in it, I won't watch it. 
~ ConsiderPhlebas


The video opens with a chapter on Martin Scorsese who once, in late 2019, was asked by Empire Magazine during an interview, about his thoughts on the current state of "Modern Cinema", in particular the Marvel cinematic universe. His response angered a lot of people. Equating Marvel movies to theme park rides, he stated - they aren't cinema. And went on to say, they're not the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional physiological experiences to another humanbeing. To which, Thoughty2 adds, this is just a nicer way of saying "They, at best, are shallow entertainment, at worst, nonsense, only good for watching when you want to put your brain into sleep mode". Head of disney tried to convince him otherwise, but Scorsese doubled down, stating in The New York Times that "The Marvel movies were devoid of genuine revelation, mystery, emotional danger and that nothing was at risk and they were inhospitable to art".

Younger generation and their spandex laden taste? May be Thoughty2 is a "mustache curmudgeon" (noun: curmudgeon - a bad-tempered person, especially an old one).

Ride in an amusement park - You feel excited, you anticipate, you shed a tear and you laugh. But your brain is shut and you don't salivate to watch another of that kind.

- Movies are frequently produced to preserve the characters like Superman by companies like Disney and Sony. The character is an asset and they don't want to lose the right to the character itself.
Examples: Latest Jason Bourne movie, Hell Raiser that was shot in 2 weeks, Fantastic Four and Spiderman releases. Characters are just based assets that can be monetized. Characters are not entire brands too e.g. Batman, James Bond, Harry Potter, Superman are brands that are in and of themselves bring hundreds of millions of dollars through games, merchandising, licensing, toys and films. Spiderman, the most popular superhero brings in over a billion. And it's important to keep these brands alive in public consciousness to keep them earning money and keep those assets profitable. This is done by constant releases of new half-baked (read: mediocre) movies.
- Y&R - Young and Rubicam, an ad agency, has declared that these characters should become the new religion.

Characters should operate as Artistic apparatus that aid story-telling, express meaningful emotion and add depth to the movie experience.



Fight Club creator David Fincher says, "If you want to make studio movies, you stay in their lanes, which are Romantic Comedy, Afflication Oscar Bait, Spandex Summer, Superhero Tentpole, Moderately Budgeted Sequel."

Affliction: A cause of pain or harm / the state of being in pain.
Tentpole: (informal•US) - a film that is expected to be very successful and so able to fund a range of related products or films. e.g."this year's big tent-pole movie was superman"



Walther PP / PPK: The Walther PPK was the weapon of choice for James Bond from the films Dr. No to Tomorrow Never (...)





Story Telling:

If you observe carefully, most of the Hollywood (modern) movies can be boiled down to the following structure. Sometimes, they play around with the way the acts are presented  or the timeline. 

Act 1:
- Person A lives in the ordinary world (full of sadness / difficulty)
- Person A feels X
- One day receives invites to adventure or a challenge
- Leaves the ordinary world

Act II:
- Encounters obstacle or enemy
- Fails multiple times
- Keeps trying, fails
- Things are at their very worst

Act III:
- Comes up with a new plan
- Rallies his strength
- Overcomes obstacles or enemies
- Feels Y, returns to the ordinary world forever changed


The message that the movie sends can be found in fables and books, and often they're excerpts from books like:
A) Aristotle's "Poetics"
B) Joseph Campbell's "Hero's Journey"

Examples:
A. "A team is stronger than an individual".
B. "You believe in yourself. You will succeed".


Q: What do these movies miss?
A: Revelations, Mystery, or Genuine Emotional Danger. Nothing is ever at risk. 


BATHOS: Worst sin in movie making, forever shall its name be cursed.
Q: Who was Bathos?
A:
Short Answer: "Undercut sincereity and weak emotional integrity"
Detailed Answer: An 18th century poet Alexander Pope coined the phrase Bathos in his essay. 'Peri Bathous', or the art of singing (or sinking?) in poetry. The pope used Bathos to describe a technique where a poet would suddenly change from serious to trivial for the sake of making the reader laugh, even if it were at the expense of the poem itself. Pope despised this, as if he felt it the based poetry and prevented the art form and topic of the poem from becoming something "greater and more transcendant".

Modern day movies have similar subject matter, as comedies. They are riddled with jokes often easily translatable visual gags as if the writers and directors are terrified that the audience might take their story seriously for a second.

Example: Avengers Infinity War:

Q: Why is Bathos so popular?
A: Because, "Humor sells better than art".

Q: What is the opposite of Bathos?
A: Pathos, that is the sincereity, that evokes pity or sadness necessary to a "moving" scene


Fun facts:
- Every Marvel movie shoots out a joke every 1:18s on average. And sadly this is the benchmark most studios want to hit.
- Disney is replicating that effort by releasing 20 movies this year.
- "Make it dark, make it grim, make it tough, but then for the love of God, tell a joke." ~Joss Whedon

How I Wrote Fight Club -  Behind the Curtain
To review further: Movie: The Graduate(1967)


- The story begins with me graduating out of college, I had these huge student loans and I had this job with my degree in journalism and I wasn't doing/feeling very well. Then, someone comes and says, "Join my church", so I go there and join the church and there were ornaments (tasks). I picked one and for me it had "Join a hospice support group and take a hospice patient on a date". Like, taking a dying person to the sea beach so that they can see the ocean for the last time. These support groups were such that you can not hide no matter how much you wanted to. The support groups really gave me new perspective because, I was thankful that I might not have a great job or life, but hey, I don't have cancer.
- Then, one day I was out hiking, vacationing and I had a huge fight (brawl) in the moutains next to a club as somebody had brought a radio to party and it was all noisy. I ended with black eyes & bruised face and then, next day I was back at work. Nobody would ask me anything about it because they'd be asking something about my private life and they did not want to. For the next three months, until my face healed, slowly turned white from back, they'll never once look me straight in the eye, it will be either to the chest or the arms or else where.
- Then came "Cacophony Society", where people had really boring, low paying jobs. They were letter carriers for the post office, there were book store clerks at Powell's. They really had structured hourly jobs to keep them engaged. [This might have kept their life monotonus, almost mechanical which might have created this need to vent it all out, to exit this labyrynth]. They needed to have chaos in their lives. So, they came up with an idea to play games, for certain hours, like 4pm to 11pm, where there will be impromptu rules, nothing organized or structured. This made them feel alive, like anarchists.
- The novel had a lot of things which couldn't make it into the movie. Any novel has the distinct advantage of describing both external behavior and internal behavior [They do this by telling you upfront. Movies can't do that. If movie characters announced themselves, it's often labelled as low effort movie making. The characters' actions should describe who it is and not it, itself]. We don't have this luxury in screenplays at all. People can just look at external behavior. Therefore, even if a scene is faithful to a novel and it works on screen to give a faithful notion of the character, then, you actually have made [or have to make] changes to the original literature.
- [Specially in the case of "Fight Club",] The narration wouldn't help the audience. So, it had to be a disembodied from the movie. So, it ultimately changed to commentary instead, where with each comment, the character will move forward[in the scenes] and not the story. The character will comment to either move the story forward or contradict what you're seeing.
- Author Chuck [], says, "My goto, for a kind of comedic effect, is the inappropriate social response to trauma. That, there's a long build-up shaggy-dog passage talking about a face printed in blood on the floor and at the end of that there is pause and instead of reacting in horror, Tyler says, 'Cool'".
- Author notes: Basically, the key to all kinds of dark humor is "Inappropriate social response to trauma", where laughter to tragedy achieves a weirdly comedic effect and it gives this feeling of getting relinquished from the shackles of society because it totally defies social acceptance. The social norms and rules have confined people from centuries and it has failed to cater to the needs of those who want to break free.

- "A great anecdote doesn't leave people speechless. It leaves people competing to tell the better version of the same thing." ~ Chuck, in a Joe Rogan interview.
- "There are so few social model novels or stories for men. For women, there are, you know, every season there is new joy Luck Club, a new How to make an American quilt. Just all these different models in which women can come together and talk about their lives and if you're a man you've got either Fight Club or the Dead Poets Society. And that is really it. So we don't have a lot of narrative that depict to men a role or a kind of script in which to come together and talk about their shed. Another thing is, Jordan Peterson, he talks about that need for really rough play. You know, we've kind of falled away from this idea of consensual rough play and I think Fight Club resonated with that a lot and also the idea of Joseph Campbell's idea that there needs to be a secondary father in men's lives that you're born if you're lucky with a biological father that you do not choose and that is the nurturing loving father that you eventually kind of have to reject but in doing so you have to choose a new father and that father by choice typically is a minister or a teacher or a drill sergeant or a coach and you kind of put yourself  in apprenticeship and agree to learn what they're gonna teach you. And that is getting harder and harder and harder to find. So, Fight Club was also depicting the new form of this secondary father with all these kids that were showing up on the doorstep of this ramshackle old house." ~ Chuck, in a Joe Rogan interview.

- The fact that Bob is involved with Fight Club

- To review further: Movie: The Graduate(1967)
- The story is about youthful dislocation and feeling of sort of entering the adult world and feeling totally out of sync with the value system that you're expected to engage in. And trying to figure out the answer to the question "how to be happy".

The Islamic apologetics movement by the likes of Yasir Qadhi, Muhammad Hijab, Adnan Rashid, Daniel Haqiqatjou which tries to preserve the centuries old myth of the perfect Quran and the perfect role model Muhammad, is now starting to crumble and being intellectually torn apart by the ex-Muslim movement thanks to people like Abdullah Sameer
, Abdullah Gondal
, Harris Sultan
 and the resulting chain reaction of the great efforts they have been putting for years in countering this dogma that is being shoved down the faces of children and non-believing adults alike, as we speak. If Islamic societies reform a lot in the upcoming years to accommodate secularism, it will be in no small part thanks to these giants. My love and solidarity for the ex-Muslim movement!


Najda Khawaja
And Ali Rizvi too.


Rohit Balakrishnan
"Rizvi’s specific criticisms of the Muslim orthodoxy as stated in the Quran are surgically accurate. He cites various passages that are either contradictory or seemingly absurd in the modern world. But this is not a moving target. For centuries we have known that the holy books of most religions have the same weaknesses. The older they are, the more they are the product of their specific time and fraught with the misinformation of that era. Rizvi’s descriptions of historical sects of Islam and their conflicts with one another are especially illuminating. He concludes that a current disagreement “would never be an issue if its consequences weren’t so deadly. In effect, it is similar to two groups fighting about whether the green or the blue unicorn is the right one.”

Here's a typical method by which, many closet religious supremacists gaslight the critics of their religion:
1. When people say positive things about the religious ideology, call it "spreading harmony".
2. When people say negative things about the religious ideology, call it "spreading hatred".
By creating this asymmetry, the stage is set for their ideology to spread, while the critics are labelled something-o-phobes.
A cunning and deceptive attempt to prevent their ideology from being mercilessly judged on the basis of merit. Sam Harris had a point when he said that religious moderates often provide cover for the religious fundamentalists.

You’re born alone and you die alone and this world just drops a bunch of rules on top of you to make you forget those facts. But I never forget. I’m living like there’s no tomorrow, because there isn’t one.

Why We Need Introverted Leaders | Angela Hucles | TEDxBend
https://youtu.be/DeUDQo1sYAw
Video Description: Athletes train to be their best by tapping into their "inner-introvert" and finding moments to lead. Hucles, two-time Olympic gold medalist, reveals why the special qualities introverts contribute to teams is invaluable for success.

Hucles is President of the Women's Sports Foundation and regular speaker on topics of sports leadership, equality, inclusion & safe spaces, anti-bullying, and the power of sport and its impact on personal growth and development. She is a member of the Advisory Board for You Can Play, a campaign dedicated to fighting homophobia in sports.


Quotes [1]:https://youtu.be/DeUDQo1sYAw?t=115

As an introvert, I definitely need my downtime, especially after being around large groups. I remember when I was working on a class assignment. 7 years old and and I was working on a class assignment. The school bell rang signalling that it was time for recess, which is one of my favorite times of the day. And I jumped up to go grab my coat. The teacher turned to me and said, Angela you can't go outside yet. You haven't finished your assignment. You can either finish it now or you stay inside the classroom. Well, that's what she said. It wouldn't be until I was an adult that I'd understand what she meant was 'stay inside the class until you finish your assignment'. Well, I loved the feeling of running around the school playground and that freedom. There was something quite peaceful. Right after all of my classmates had left the room. In that moment, I observed this "peace", this "quiet". I remember there was sun streaming in from the window and this feeling of energy flowing back to me. This is my earliest memory of enjoying and needing that quiet and recharging time as an introvert. So, you can imagine my surprise when I turned to the teacher and said I was just fine staying inside the classroom to wait until recess was over, instead of doing my assignment. She escorted me right down to the principal's office [laughter].

Why Americans Eat Dessert for Breakfast
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNovwPIWr3Q

Key Takeaways:
[1] Most American Breakfasts are desserts disguised as breakfasts. American Breakfasts are just  modified versions of European breakfasts e.g. Waffles and Pan Cakes but loaded, decorated with sugary syrup, or cream, or a dollop of melting butter, or in some sad cases, even icing.
[2] Except for children and growing teenagers, there's no credible evidence to suggest that breakfast did any good. Most of the research papers were actually backed by companies like Kellogs themselves. 
[3] The shift in demand for quick breakfasts like cereals and health drinks, which are loaded with sugar, came when there emerged a need during rapid industrialization. Workers had to go to factories in the morning and a quick bite that kept them full was important. That's when Kellogs came in, with their marketing attempts to mass manufacture Corn flakes & sell them at competitive prices, compounded with the ad campaign that sold the idea that "breakfast is the most important meal of the day".
[4] Donuts - donuts make no attempt to disguise themselves as breakfasts. They're clearly desserts and some how Americans are inclined to eat them as breakfasts. Part of the reason why Dunking Donuts failed in India was because of the breakfast eating habits in the subcontinet. The breakfast is usually savory, rarely sweet.

So, I noticed a self proclaimed ‘Sanatani Hindu, Bhartiya Naari’ twitter handle from Jaipur that goes by the name Kirti Goswami saying how offended she was by a song - 'কলঙ্কিনী রাধা' / 'Kalankini Radha’ - that features in the film - ‘Bulbbul’ that has been released on Netflix. The song features as a fragment, and that fragment is heard, sort of half-sung, casually by two of the film’s characters. The second time we hear it, the person who invokes the song makes it clear that it is the kind of song that a Baul, a wandering minstrel, would sing.
Kirti Goswami takes particular offence to the words ‘কানু হারামজাদা' / 'Kanu Haramjada’ and 'কলঙ্কিনী রাধা' / 'Kalankini Radha’, and states that these words, and  the song from which these words are taken, as written by Shah Abdul Karim, are insulting to Hinduism. 
Before this flame becomes a forest fire, as it might, given WhatsApp University, some clarifications are in order. 
I have now seen the film, and as I said, its a very minor part of the film’s action. I know the song well, as do many people raised in Bengali homes. It is a beloved part of a repertoire of Vaishnav songs sung in the Baul-folk traditions of undivided Bengal, Sylhet and in the Kamrup region (borderlands between Bengal and Assam). It also sometimes features in the form known as ‘জলভরা গান' / 'Jol-Bhora Gaan’ (‘Water-Filling Songs’, but also punning, as ‘liquid songs’) songs that are sung, especially by women, riffing off the trope of Radha going to fill water from the river Yamuna, as a ‘cover’ for assignations with her lover, Krishna. 
These songs, which echo the material of Jayadeva’s ‘Gita-Govinda’ in a popular idiom, are of intense and explicit erotic longing. They are a living, breathing element of the very ‘sanatani’ Vaishnav devotional traditions of Bengal and it’s borderlands. Perhaps the different versions of these songs, claimed by different languages and dialects of the fluid terrain Eastern India (and parts of present day Bangladesh) devolve back to some ur-source in the Magadhi Apabhramsha from which Maithili, Oriya, Kamrupi, Sylheti, Gauriya (whIch becomes Bengali) and Assamese rise. The layers and complexities of this terrain, which demolish the entire notion of borders and boundaries, is difficult for the exclusionary mind of latter day Hindutva to grasp. And  I really wonder what upcountry Hindutva champions will do if they ever get to know how devout Bengalis and other peoples of Eastern India have addressed Shiva, Kali and Durga to express their affection and intimacy over centuries?
The themes of a - ‘calumnised’, literally,  ‘stained’ (‘Kalankini’) Radha, who
is addressed as such by the song’s primary voice (presumably Radha’s fellow Gopi, who also curses Krishna/Kanu and calls him ‘Haramjada’ (bastard), is an indication of the intensity of Radha’s erotic longing. This is seen as an earthy metaphor for a true devotee’s ecstatic spiritual longing. They do not ‘insult’ Krishna and Radha, but profess a deep intimacy with them. 
The author of this exact version of the song is unknown but it is certainly not Shah Abdul Karim, it gets credited in a number of instances as the work of a poet-balladeer - রাধারমণ দত্ত (Radharaman Datta) (1833-1915), a well known Vaishnava bhakta, who was born and lived in Sylhet, undivided Bengal. This attribution is uncertain. The words of the song carry the sibilant impress of dialects of Bangla and its related languages, especially as they are spoken in Kamrup (Kamrupi dialects of Western Assam and North Bengal) and Sylhet. Whatever the case may be, there exist works in the Radharaman corpus that have similar tropes - Krishna sitting on the branches of the Kadam tree, waiting to waylay Radha, the admonition to Radha, voiced by her friends, not to go down that path to the riverbank, , the figure of stain, or কলঙ্ক, etc. An identification of this verse with Radharaman may or may not be accurate, but it’s not entirely unthinkable. This phenomenon of the condensation of claims to authorship of diverse body of material around a single figure and his corpus is not unknown or unfamilar to us. It’s not unlike the phenomenon of the attribution of many verses to say, a notional Kabir, even though the actual Kabir may never have written them. 
I have been able to consult a published collection of Radharaman Datta’s lyrics - বাউল কবি রাধারমণ : গীতি সংগ্রহ (Baul Poet Radharaman : Collected Songs) edited by Bijonkrishna Chaudhuri (Published by Book World, Agartala, 2009). While this collection does not feature this particular version, there are many others like it, with the familiar trope of Krishna on the branch of the Kadamba tree. Radharaman refers to Radha as Kalankini several times, across several songs.
See for instance this one, a ‘dhamail’ song (- a popular Sylheti form), definitely by Radharaman Datta - 
ঐ শোন কদম্বতলে বাঁশি বাজায় কে।
বাঁশি বাজায় কে রে সখি, বাঁশি বাজায় কে ॥
এগো নাম ধরিয়া বাজায় বাঁশি, তারে আনিয়া দে।
অষ্ট আঙ্গুল বাঁশের বাঁশি, মধ্যে মধ্যে ছেদা
নাম ধরিয়া বাজায় বাঁশি, কলঙ্কিনী রাধা ॥
কোন বা ঝাড়ের বাঁশের বাঁশি, ঝাড়ের লাগাল পাই।
জড়ে পেড়ে উগরাইয়া, সায়রে ভাসাই ॥
ভাইবে রাধারমণ বলে, শুন গো ধনি রাই।
জলে গেলে হবে দেখা, ঠাকুর কানাই ॥
(My woefully inadequate paraphrased translation of this verse would be - ‘O listen, who plays the flute by the Kadamba tree. Who plays the flute, friend, who plays the flute? 
Who plays the flute calling out her name, calling her. Eight fingers on a bamboo flute, holes in between. Plays the flute and calls her name - ‘Kalankini’ Radha. Which bamboo grove gave that stem, and which stem that flute ? Root and branch, I’ll take that bush and float it in the river. Listen, brother Radharaman says, listen lady Radha. Go to the waterside, there you will find Krishna’) 
This verse, as is evident, shares much of the same substance. Radha is clearly ‘Kalankini’ and Krishna, while he is not called ‘Haramjada’ is referred to as ‘Kulnasha’ (lineage destroyer) more than once; and in at least two places is referred to as লম্পট (‘lampat’ - a very strong insult - translates as ‘characterless, licentious, lewd). 
Let’s look at one such instance. This is song no. 477. 
Radharaman’s words are as follows : 
ভরতে গেলাম যমুনাতে শীতল গঙ্গা জল গো 
রূপ নেহারি প্রাণসজনী মন করিল চঞ্চল 
নান্দের সুন্দর চিকন কালা জানে নানা কল 
কাদা করি চিকন কালা ঘাট করিল পিছল 
আলগা থাকিয়া কালায় হাসে খলখল 
ভাবিয়া রাধারমণ বলে শুন গো ধ্বনি রাই 
কুলবধূর কুল মজাইল লম্পট কানাই  
Roughly translated this would be : 
[ I went to fetch cool pure water from the Yamuna
Sweetheart (Radha addressing her companion, a Gopi) my heart went a-flutter when I saw his beauty there, Nanda’s slippery/gleaming (as in the colloquial Hindi चिकना / chikna) , dark pretty boy (Krishna) he know’s many tricks. He made the river bank slippery (I fell) and he stood laughing. 
Imagining this Radharaman (the poet, this is his ‘signature’ line, or, ভনিতা) says -  ‘O Radha, this licentious, ‘lampat’ Kanai (Krishna), made a laughing-stock of your family’s honour’. ] (in fact, as Radharaman points out in more than one song, Radha is a wide, and the family whose ‘honour’ is compromised by her adultery with Krishna is that of her husband and in-laws, which is a pretty grave matter).
The word লম্পট / ‘lampat’ carries a strong moral judgement, some would say, as strong, or stronger, than ‘haramjada’. It could be argued that a without ‘lampats’ breaking the codes of proper sexual relations, there would be no ‘Haramjadas’ (illegitimate offspring). Radharaman’s entire corpus points out again and again, like many Vaishnav poets do, the পরকীয়া, transgressive,  nature of the Radha-Krishna bond. In fact, in Radharaman’s world, it is ‘spiritual’ because it is transgressive. The versions that speak of ‘Kalankini Radha’ and ‘Haramjada Kanu’ know what they are doing. By emphasising, even valuing,  transgression, they are placing themselves squarely within the ethos of the kind of Vaishnava Bhakti that was both Radharaman Datta’s inheritance and legacy. 
Incidentally, ‘Baul Samrat’ Shah Abdul Karim, another Sylheti, a famous Bangladeshi folk singer, who died in 2009, did write a love/devotional song titled ‘আমি কুলহারা কলঙ্কিনী' / ‘Ami kul-hara Kalankini’, but that song has no mention of Krishna/Kanu or Radha.) * [ for anyone who is interested, and can read Bangla, I’ve added the lyrics of both songs, ‘Kalankini Radha’ (popularly attributed to Radharaman Datta but which may not be authored by him), and ‘Ami Kul-Hara Kalankini’ by Shah Abdul Karim, in the comments section. ] *
Kirti Goswami’s twitter rant, once again shows how 
‘Sanatani Hindu’ loudmouths like her regularly end up demonstrating their own profound ignorance of the traditions that they claim to uphold and protect.
[ Those  who know Bengali, and want to know more about Radharaman Datta and ‘Jol Bhora’ songs - can read the excellent monograph - ‘লোকায়ত জীবন ও লোকসাহিত্য’ (‘Lokayata Jibon o Lokshahitya’ - Folk Life and Folk Literature) by Suman Kumar Das. Published by Atmajaa Publishers, Kolkata. 
For a collection of Radharaman Datta’s songs - see বাউল কবি রাধারমণ : গীতি সংগ্রহ (Baul Poet Radharaman : Collected Songs) edited by Bijonkrishna Chaudhuri (Published by Book World, Agartala, 2009)]
Update: Kirti Goswami has now deleted this particular tweet. But the substance of the tweet is now being shared by a number of other accounts, pointing to a more concerted IT Cell Style effort. I’ve included a link to an article in the Free Press Journal that indexes this as well as screenshots of three other sample tweets in the comments below.
I have amended some portions of this post, especially on the question of the authorship and language of the song, after a fruitful exchange with Shabnam Surita and Sudipto Chakrabarty (of ‘Dohar’ a folk band who have a superb rendition of the song) in the comments below, and after having seen the film, and read through the collection of Radharaman Datta’s songs.

Abhinandan Banerjee:
If legally Hindu marriage laws apply to a couple, then yes, this verdict is legally valid.
What you are questioning is the presence of a legal code that is clearly anti-equality within our laws. The problem with that is, our government, as Sankhadeep pointed out in his live, believes in Sarva Dharma Sambhava, and not Sarba Dharma Abhava. Also, the court may point out that you as a materialist agnostic/athiest have no locus standii in this just as a Hindu has no locus standii in Triple Talaq.

In short, this case is a laundry list for why we need UCC.

locus standi
/ˌləʊkəs ˈstandʌɪ,ˌlɒkəs ˈstandʌɪ/
nounLaw
noun: locus standi; plural noun: loci standi

    the right or capacity to bring an action or to appear in a court.
    "a foreign government which has not been recognized by the UK government has no locus standi in the English courts"

Origin
Latin, literally ‘place of standing’.

Author Notes: Not just this, refusing to wear mangal sutra or pressuring the groom to live away from his parents counts.

Even refusing to have sex with the legally wed husband is considered cruelty because conjugal rights are reserved in the Hindu marriage act.

UCC definitely makes a lot of sense.

Gau HC | Refusal to wear "sakha & sindoor" is clear intention that a hindu wife is unwilling to continue conjugal life: Divorce decreed to husband | SCC Blog



Gauhati High Court: A Division Bench of Ajai Lamba, CJ and Soumitra Saikia, J., granted a decree of divorce to the appellant-husband on the grounds of cruelty by the respondent-wife.
Background of the Case

Appellant husband lived with his mother, sister and brother, After his marriage bother respondent wife and appellant husband started their conjugal life in the matrimonial house of the appellant.

After about a month of their marriage, respondent wife demanded to reside separately with the appellant husband away from the husband’s relatives in a separate house. Appellant being a contractual labourer was not able to sustain separate accommodation for him and his wife as he was required to render service at a place away from his matrimonial house.

Appellant husband in the face of persistent demands by the respondent wife for separate accommodation also attempted to take the respondent wife to his place of work by arranging separate accommodation away from the matrimonial home. However, the respondent wife continued to resort to frequent quarrels with the appellant and started blaming him for the couple not being able to have a child after marriage. The respondent wife alleged that the appellant husband was medically unfit.

Later, respondent wife declared that she was not willing to continue her matrimonial life with the appellant and further insisted on going back home. Respondent wife also filed a case under Section 498(A) Penal Code, 1860.

Appellant husband contended that the respondent wife compelled the appellant to execute a written agreement to the effect that the couple will stay in a separate rental house together away from the joint family of the husband and further that the appellant/husband’s family members will not visit them or maintain any relations with them.

In view of the above agony faced by the husband, he filed a divorce case against the wife.

Respondent wife contended that she was subjected to extreme cruelty by the appellant’s step-mother, sister-in-law, brother and his two sisters.

According to the respondent, the family members of the appellant tortured her physically and mentally by demanding various cash and kinds from her as dowry and also declined to provide her the bare necessities of life. She further stated that the respondent declined to provide her medical treatment, wearing apparels, adequate food and medicine etc. which are provided to her by her brother. She further stated that she was assaulted and sent back to her brother’s house by the appellant and his family members demanding her to bring money from her house.

    Upon due consideration of the evidence, the court below came to the finding that there was no cruelty extended to the appellant husband and his family members or that they were neglected by the respondent wife and accordingly rejected the petition for divorce by the husband.

High Court noted that respondent wife did not dispute on the fact that there was an agreement wherein appellant was required to provide separate accommodation to the respondent wife, where appellant’s family members were not permitted.

Under the custom of Hindu Marriage, a lady who has entered into marriage according to Hindu rituals and customs, and which has not been denied by the respondent in her evidence, her refusal to wear ‘sakha and sindoor’ will project her to be unmarried and/or signify her refusal to accept the marriage with the appellant. Such categorical stand of the respondent points to the clear intention of the respondent that she is unwilling to continue her conjugal life with the appellant.

In view of the above, it can be said that the wife inflicted cruelty upon the appellant and his family members.

Family Court erred in evaluating the evidence in the proper perspective. Acts of lodging criminal cases on unsubstantiated allegations against the husband and/or the husband’s family members amounts to cruelty.

Bench also cited a Supreme Court Decision — Rani Narasimha Sastri v. Rani Suneela Rani, 2019 SCC OnLine SC 1595, wherein it was held that

    filing of criminal cases like case under Sections 498(A) IPC etc. against the husband and the family members and which are subsequently dismissed/rejected by the Family Court, is sufficient to be construed as an act of cruelty by the wife.

Adding to its conclusion, Court also stated that under the “Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 children shall mandatorily be required to maintain parents and senior citizens.

Thus, it is evident that the lower Court completely ignored the fact that the respondent compelled and prevented the appellant from performing his statutory duties towards his aged mother.

Hence, the above stated is sufficient to construe as an act of cruelty leading to punishment or imprisonment as well as fine.

Impugned judgment of the Family Court be overturned in view of the discussions rendered. Divorce decree is allowed and marriage between the appellant husband and respondent wife is dissolved.[Bhaskar Das v. Renu Das, 2020 SCC OnLine Gau 2954 , decided on 19-06-2020]

Microsoft was valued at 0.9 trillion dollars in 1999, at the height of the dot com bubble.
Apple in 2018 became a trillion dollar company. This is due to the persistent popularity of the iPhone which makes 70% of the company's profits. It makes Apple richer than all nations worldwide, except for 15 [India, China, Australlia, Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, Japan, Canada and of course, the United States].
Standard Oil: In 1900, this company was worth 1 trillion dollars. It was later broken into several major oil companies by the US government [Chevron, Exxon Mobil, BP]
Petro China: In 2007, it was valued at 1.4 trillion dollars, right when oil prices were peak, just before the GFC [Financial crisis of 2007–2008]
Saudi AramCo: 4.1 trillion at its peak in 2010.

South Sea Company: 4.3 trillion dollars in 1720 [adjusted for inflation]
Missisipi Company: 6.5 trillion dollar company in 1720 [adjusted for inflation]

Dutch East India Company: 7.9 trillion dollars in 1637
Story starts in Netherlands, in a time called "The Golden Century", a period of Dutch history between 1600 and 1700 when Amsterdam was one of the richest cities in the world due to its strong international trade. Trade is how essentially all countries made their money.

In 1600, the Dutch government was worried about England becoming dominant in trade. So, they created The Dutch East India company in 1602 and allowed them to become a monopoly in Asian trade. It quickly became a dominant player in the trade of spices between Europe and Indonesia.

The Dutch East India company was the very first company to go public in the World's first stock exchange. [Snippet from the web: Amsterdam Stock Exchange. It was established in 1602 by the Dutch East India Company (Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie or VOC) which issued the first shares on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. It was the first company to issue stocks and bonds. It was renamed the Amsterdam Bourse and was the first to formally begin trading in securities]. From here it continued to grow until it had 70,000 employees at its peak. In 1600, that was more than 0.01% of the world's population working for this one company. The firm ran their own ship yards and built a network of 100s of bases and had offices, warehouses to heavy work stations. In order to keep their ports and continue trade, Dutch East India company developed their own army to protect the land that they gained. As the company grew, the foreign colonies gained more land and posssed a sense of governmental power. The Dutch East India company had the power to wage war, negotiate treaties, mint its own coins and even establish new colonies. The company was even used to fight against the Spanish empire in the 1600s. Funnily, this was a publicly traded company doing all these.

Q: What was the most valueable product they traded?
A: Flower, to be precise: Tulip

Tulips were first introduced to Europe from Turkey and reached Amsterdam in 1554. The plants were immediately perceived as exotic goods and their popularity began to rise. Having tulips in your garden became an important status symbol. In addition to this, Tulips take 7-12 months to flower and only bloom for about a week.

Dutch were pioneers in marketing. They invented the futures trade, the same kind we trade stocks with today.

It was 1630s and an average person was expected to live fewer than 40 years and rarely expected to make any money at all. Some traders who were hoarding Tulips to make a profit made 62000 dollars a month.

Introduction to Carl Jung - The Psyche, Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0KzUS0b_uc

“Man has developed consciousness slowly and laboriously, in a process that took untold ages to reach the civilized state. And this evolution is far from complete, for large areas of the human mind are still shrouded in darkness.” (Man and His Symbols, Carl Jung)

	Introduction to Carl Jung – The Psyche, Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious


Concept of Psyche:

[1] Knowledge of the psyche, how it worked and how one could influence its functioning was of the utmost concern for Jung. Broadly speaking Jung divided the psyche into three main realms:  consciousness,  the personal unconscious and  the collective unconscious.

[2] The different realms of the psyche are not completely separate from each other but instead  continually interact in a compensatory manner. This dynamic interplay between the conscious and unconscious realms of the psyche leads, as we will see, to the potential for personal  growth and change through what Jung termed the individuation process. 

[Author Notes]:
- The word originally meant "soul" or "spirit". By the turn of 20th century, it increasingly came to refer to "mind". In Jung-ian psychology, one psychology can be seen as their total perosonality which encompasses one's thoughts, behaviours, feelings and emotions.
- How psyche works and how one can influece it - was one of Jung's primary concerns.
- Jung divided Psyche into 3 main realms.
	- Consciousness
	- The personal unconscious
	- The collective unconscious
- The different realms of psyche aren't completely different from each other but they instead continually interact with each other in a compensatory manner and this interplay eventually shapes one's "personal growth and change" called as the "individuation process".


Consciousness:
[1] Consciousness – that realm of the psyche most familiar to us. The conscious realm of the psyche can be  described as one’s field of awareness and consists of those psychic contents that one knows. At the centre of this field of awareness  was what Jung called the ego. The ego is one’s personality as they are aware of it firsthand.
[2] The ego plays a crucial role in each person’s life as it acts as a  gatekeeper which influences what contents of experience are reflected in consciousness and which contents are eliminated, repressed, or ignored. The ego, in its role as gatekeeper, helps determine the content of the next main area of the psyche we will look at – the personal unconscious.

[Author Notes]: Similar concept as Freudian "ego" where the "ego" works as a gatekeeper which influences what contents of experience are reflected and which contents are ignored.



Personal Unconscious:
As Jung  writes:

    “There are certain events of which we have not consciously taken note; they have remained, so to speak, below the threshold of consciousness. They have happened, but they have been absorbed subliminally.” (Man and His Symbols, Carl Jung)

These events that have been absorbed subliminally occupy the personal unconscious. The word subliminal translates to  “below the threshold”, so what Jung means is that there are many events that  the ego represses or disregards, for various reasons, be it that they are too distressing or simply forgotten or deemed insignificant. But these events do not disappear completely from the psyche but instead  occupy the personal unconscious and continue to have the potential to influence one’s personality. It must be stressed that the unconscious realm is not merely a receptacle for forgotten memories, rather as we mentioned earlier the unconscious and conscious realms of the psyche dynamically interact, both playing an integral role in the life of the individual. 


[Author Notes]: The ego represses many events that are either too distressing, or simply forgotten or deemed insignificant

Vitamin D and Depression: Where is all the Sunshine?

Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting about 121 million people (World Health Organization [WHO], 2008). In the United States, 14.8 million (or about 6.7%) adults have depression. Depression is the leading cause of disability for Americans between the ages of 15 and 44 (National Institutes of Mental Health [NIMH], 2008). Currently, the WHO has determined that depression is ranked fourth on the global burden of disease list. The rates of depression continue to increase and the WHO predicts that it will be the second most common global burden of disease by the year 2020. Depression costs $36.6 billion and 225 million lost workdays each year in the United States (NIMH, 2006).

People say you should introduce only your worst enemy to opium.

Bombay changed from a collection of 7 uninhabitable malarial islands between 1800 and 1840 into a great metropolis and the financial capital of India because the East India Company and a handful of Parsi ship owners shipped hundreds of tons of opium to China and made a lot of money. At that time the East India Company was the worlds largest drug pushers and like pushers anywhere else in the world they were incredibly brutal. It transformed the fortunes of Bombay.
Today there are a lot of hospital and colleges named after them and people have no idea where that fortune was built on and the history books very conveniently omit the fact of opium.

Unfollowed a lot of girls on Instagram cos all they had to offer was pics of them being beautiful. That’s it. It doesn’t even portray how one is as a person (good/evil /pure) etc
After a while it all becomes boring and repetitive. Sometimes I wonder what are their career plans. Cos likes aint gonna pay your bills.

Being beautiful is nice and all but I am sure there is more to a person than that. Try to use your social media to portray who you really are. Be it an artist, singer, entrepreneur, social worker, gamer, tiktoker its your call. A quick glance over a profile should be able to show what that person likes and is passionate about. If you haven’t figured that out yet then do it before the world ends.

Edit: I didn’t anticipate this many people will get triggered over this. I’m just a random stranger on the internet and my opinion shouldn’t matter that much to spoil your day. I don’t have any control over what you post. Its totally yours. You can be as interesting or as hollow as you’re. Choice is yours.

For the people commenting “who asked”, bro you’re literally on my profile and that’s why you’re seeing it. If you disagree then you can discuss or just keep scrolling. There’s no pressure. It’s my profile and all the opinion that I post are mine.
If you saw this post from someone’s share, then ask them why they shared it cos I don’t even know you probably to tell you this.


Sanved Tapkeer
To be honest, I have been feeling the same but on a much bigger scale. Almost every post on the internet is about flexing. Looking sharp ? Flex it. Looking glamorous ? Flex it. Out for travels ? Flex it. Bought yourself something fancy ? Flex it. Every social media app out there exists only for that dose of validation. People who don't have any other source of validation would be extremely lost without it. 


Ananya Barman
When you think about it, everything we do on social media is about validation. Even the person who posted this status did it so someone on social media would validate his opinions and it's amazing how you were able to figure this out but you can't admit that you use social media for the same reason. Some use it to validate their looks or material things they own and some use it to validate their opinions or judgements, regardless we're all here for the same reason and claiming anything otherwise just makes you a hypocrite.

perhaps. your opinion, put out publicly, on a public forum, about matters that include the public in general.

with all due respect, sir, you're sitting there with a shady looking profile, passing public judgements on alternative ways of earning and identity establishment, it's a bit ironic for you to do that.

on the social media, one might maintain any form of artistry with their identity, be it a random tomfoolery or legitimate business. I am sure a middle aged brown rightist politically incorrect privileged person's validation wouldn't matter to them. oh wait, that's the problem.

I apologise if any part of my comment has hurt your sentiments, but I honestly believe you can do better than hide behind a seemingly fake profile (but definitely it's your choice what profile you'll hide behind on the internet), and spread hate about almost anything remotely new shooting accross the horizon. Instead try to recognise the developmental stages that the internet and life of a human in this day and age is going through, assist it if you can, but please, there's enough hatred in the world, stop spreading more.

I don't know if you understood a word of what I typed, I hope you did. G'day.

Anuj, actually the post is spreading on the very point of it being suggestive of one course of action in the formation of someone's tailored virtual identity. As much as what you said is true and good willed, somewhere, it's not possible/plausible or feasible for some people to put up posts or information about their work-life, professional lifestyle or just real world identity in general. The reasons behind that might range from the desire of the creation of an alter ego (like physicists who are also fashion bloggers), to just plain and simple anonymity (*JP IT Cell). This, is what is being questioned on policing grounds by what you had put out, or so it seems.

As much as keeping information about oneself on their own profiles, happens to be completely under their personal decision. Some might want to stay behind a fake profile and spam random women wih dick pics, or one might do the same to reverse scam scammers or another might use the same for spreading fake news. The purpose is different in each sector. The reach/audience to each, however, is always organic to the idea of the profile that's formed, unless someone calls themselves an influencer and their influenced audience is just a set of freaking bots. That is when I would like to burst a bottle on their head too. But, other than that, it truly is and should be one's choice about how to appear in the social media.

Any form of judgement on someone's real/virtual identity, unless specifically asked for or harmful to others, would be hate, don't you think?

The differences between free markets and capitalism are stark. Free markets mean minimal state interference in the economy. Capitalism means private ownership of the means of production.

A capitalist would support bailouts during recession, a free marketeer wouldn't. A capitalist would oppose taxes on land and negative externalities, cuz 🅱️rofits, a free marketeer wouldn't. Capitalist developers in Mumbai ironically back zoning, free marketeers oppose zoning.

Defend markets, not capitalists.

Why is pop culture so disdainful of the ‘conformist’ salaried class?
Anand Vardhan
7-9 minutes

Some films will have you believe that the ‘free spirits’ are the true heroes. But not everyone has the luxury of indulging in flights of fancy.

In recent years, the negative portrayal of engineers in India’s popular culture has often acted as a subtext for something else. The larger target is derision towards regular officer-goers, the millions of Indians engaged in salaried work. By glorifying unconventional “career rebels”, various forms of popular culture have found it useful to scoff at the banality of working hours — though the world runs on the sweat of the salaried and wage-earning class.

More recently in the literary world, reports on writer Kritika Pandey winning the Commonwealth Short Story prize quoted her as saying her parents, like “all aspirational middle class people”, wanted her to be an engineer. Pandey said she “hated” her engineering college, and that shifting to studying fine arts and writing was something of a fight against the middle class expectations of her family in Ranchi.

Any small-towner will understand the roadblocks Pandey overcame to detour from the well-trodden path. But such a journey is not always a vindication against the thoroughfare.

There’s a fashionable ridicule reserved for the “conformist” salaried types in the artistic portrayals of contemporary India. Before we identify some of them, it’s interesting to remind ourselves of the biases against the regular workforce vis-à-vis the offbeat professional, or even an idler, in cinematic portrayals. These biases have seeped into popular culture in general, especially with mainstream cinema forming a significant part of it.

Of late, in many mainstream Hindi movies woven around the boy-gets-girl plot, regular work life is portrayed as a serious disadvantage for the romantic prospects of a salaried worker. It’s like Bollywood screenwriters muddled up what JM Coetzee offered in his semi-fictional work, Youth.

These Hindi movies show artistic “free spirits” and non-conformists as lovable, more likely to walk away with the heroine. For instance, in Aditya Chopra’s Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008), the state electricity department employee, Surinder Suri, was on the verge of being cuckolded by Raj, the cool dancing version of himself, before melodrama saved his marriage.

Imtiaz Ali’s Tamasha (2015) almost relegated regular work life to a vice, as if the luxury of indulging one’s wishes and fanciful flights was something everyone can or should afford. Predictably, it was the distance between office work and the “follow your passion” trope that helped Ved get his Tara in the film. One wonders what kind of world we will have if every office worker decides to respond to that follow-your-passion itch.

This hasn’t always been the case in mainstream Bollywood, and it isn’t always the case now. However, a significant number of films have pushed certain stereotypes about conventional professions. In the 1970s, middle-class romcoms by directors such as Basu Chatterjee had a slice of metropolitan office life which, despite certain stereotypes, were sympathetic to 9-to-5 office types. However, they also sometimes caricatured characters who were work-focused.

For instance, one of the key differences between Vijay Anand’s Guide (1965) and RK Narayan’s eponymous novel, on which it was based, was how the work-focused nature of aging archaeologist Marco was caricatured in the film, but not in the novel. In the film, it was contrived as a juxtaposition, perhaps to make the seductive guide Raju more likeable and tempting for Rosie to commit adultery.

However, there was one film that had no such difference with its source. In Devdas, the Bengali novel and the Hindi film it inspired, the plot revolved around the inexplicable appeal of a languishing and hedonistic idler for women who know what they are doing.

In the literary world, two aspects need attention. First, a dismissive attitude towards regular professions doesn’t help in grasping the dignity of ordinariness. Restoring that banality could be a challenging task in literature. Engineering, for instance, might be the default or ingrained choice for millions and the dedicated pursuit of excellence for only a few. But the reality is that it’s performing core functions in important sectors of the economy, while creating and maintaining technical systems everywhere.

The point of individual aptitude is important, but so is the aspect of limited opportunities, and the fact that many cannot identify their own aptitude for a specific role unless it becomes a matter of earning for them. This is also the case with many other conventional professions.

A conversation at the beginning of Upamanyu Chatterjee’s debut novel English, August, (1988) captures this aspect quite well.

The novel begins with a chat in a car between the young IAS probationer Agastya Sen and his Yale-alumnus friend Dhrubo.

Dhrubo: “…But here in Delhi, all over India, education is biding time, a meaningless accumulation of degrees, BA, MA, then an M.PhiL while you join the millions in trying your luck at the Civil Services exam. So many people every year seem to find government service so interesting.”

Agastya: “You’re wrong about education, though. Most must be like me, with no special aptitude for anything. Try your luck with everything, something hopefully will click. There aren’t unlimited opportunities in the world.”

The second aspect in the literary world is that in the absence of any links to the working lives of millions, there is the possibility of writers becoming captives to their perch. It brings a kind of distance which numerous writing tours can’t bridge; it’s almost being out of touch with how people work in the world beyond the writing desk.

For example, when writers Patrick French and Pankaj Mishra were having a spat in the pages of Outlook in 2011, a reader alluded to this point. The reader had remarked that Mishra and French could have handled the situation better if they ever worked in an office. A year later, in an interview with the Hindu, journalist and novelist Manu Joseph recalled the scary experience of attending a writer’s conference in Edinburgh. According to him, it was appalling to see that writers were quite naïve about using their faculties in any other context except the themes on which they wrote.

In the same interview, Joseph suggested that writers should spend some time in a profession, in an office. Ironically, Joseph’s second novel, The Illicit Happiness of Other People — the release of which occasioned this interview — was unsparing in its disdain for the aspiring engineers preparing for the entrance tests in Madras of the 1980s.

Interestingly, even though journalism is a salaried profession and does need office work at different levels, some journalists carry the impression of being associated with an offbeat choice. A few even see it as a “rebel” career.

One is reminded of an interesting incident in a panel discussion. Perhaps sensing that Chandan Mitra, journalist and then editor of the Pioneer, was distancing his identity from a mainstream career choice in India, Mani Shankar Aiyar reminded Mitra of either his failure in clearing or timidity in not attempting the civil services examination. “Journalists are people who either flunked or funked the civil services examination,” Aiyar said.

In restoring the dignity of the ordinary and regular ways in which people earn their livings, popular culture and even the world of letters can find many extraordinary tales too. It’s not only the detour, the thoroughfare too witnesses remarkable journeys, and very useful ones indeed.

The film was a box office hit upon release.[2] The movie proved memorable for its award-winning performances by the lead actors and memorable music by S. D. Burman. Time magazine listed it at Number Four on its list of Best Bollywood Classics.[3]

A 120-minute U.S. version was written by Pearl S. Buck, and directed and produced by Tad Danielewski.[4] The film was screened at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, 42 years after its release.[5]
Plot[edit source]

The movie starts with Raju (Dev Anand) being released from jail. Raju was a freelance guide, who earned his living by taking tourists to historic sites. One day, a wealthy and aging archaeologist, Marco (Kishore Sahu) comes to the city with his young wife Rosie (Waheeda Rehman), the daughter of a courtesan. Marco wants to do some research on the caves outside the city and hires Raju as his guide.

While Marco devotes himself to the discovery of the cave, Raju takes Rosie on a tour and appreciates her dancing ability and innocence. He learns about Rosie's background as a daughter of a courtesan and how Rosie has achieved respectability as the wife of Marco but at a terrible cost. She had to give up her passion for dancing since it was unacceptable to Marco. Meanwhile, Rosie tries to commit suicide by consuming poison. Marco, upon learning of the incident, returns from the caves to see Rosie and is furious with Rosie after seeing her alive. He tells her that her act of committing suicide was a drama, otherwise, she would have consumed more sleeping pills so that she could really have died. Upon returning to the caves which were discovered, Rosie learns that Marco is spending time and enjoying the company of a native tribal girl. She is enraged at Marco and both indulge in a seriously heated discussion, which concludes with Rosie leaving the caves, and she once again wants to end her life.

Raju calms her down by saying that committing suicide is a sin and that she should live to pursue her dream. She finally says good-bye to the relation of being the wife of Marco. Now she needs support and a home. Raju gives her shelter. Rosie is considered a prostitute by Raju's community (as classical dancing traditionally was prostitutes' work at royal courts), which leads to many problems, including his mother and her brother insisting that Rosie be kicked out. Raju refuses and his mother leaves him. His friend and driver also fall out with him over Rosie. Raju loses his business and the entire town turns against him. Undeterred by these setbacks, Raju helps Rosie embark on a singing and dancing career and Rosie becomes a star. As she rises as a star, Raju becomes dissolute — gambling and drinking. Marco comes back on the scene. Trying to win Rosie back, he brings flowers and has his agent ask Rosie to release some jewelry which is in a safe deposit box. Raju, a bit jealous, does not want Marco to have any contact with Rosie and forges Rosie's name on the release of the jewels. Meanwhile, Rosie and Raju drift apart due to Rosie's incomprehensible behaviour when she tortures Raju by not obliging him a caring hug even and asks him to leave her room else she says she will have to go out. Before this, they also had a discussion about how a man should live when Rosie remembers Marco and tells Raju that Marco was probably correct when he used to say that a man should not live on a woman's earnings.

Raju retorts by saying that she is under a misunderstanding that she has become a star on her own and it was only because of Raju's efforts that she became famous. Later, Rosie learns of the forgery release. Raju is convicted of forgery, resulting in a two-year sentence. Rosie does not understand why Raju indulged in forgery when he could have easily asked her for money. It was not money, it was the loving fascination for Rosie which urged Raju not to reveal Marco's visit to Rosie so that she doesn't remember him again and to eliminate the probability of Rosie and Marco's togetherness if at all, there was any little chance. On the day of his release, his mother and Rosie come to pick him up but they are told that he was released six months ago because of his good behaviour.

Meanwhile, upon his release, Raju wanders alone. Despair, poverty, rags, hunger, and loneliness engulf him until he finds a wandering group of sadhus (holy men) with whom he spends a night at a derelict temple in a small town. Raju impresses the woman with the logic in taking a husband and she submits, which convinces Bhola that Raju is a swami (holy man). Impressed by this, Bhola spreads the news through the village. Raju is taken as a holy man by the village. Raju assumes the role of village holy man (Swami Ji) and engages in skirmishes with the local pandits. And drama started here. Due to drought Raju was forced to fast for 12 days so that it rains. Meanwhile, his mother, friend, and Rosie unite with him and patch things up. In the end, it rains but Raju dies.

Production[edit source]

Dev Anand was approached by American director Tad Danielewski and Pearl Buck to be cast in an American film based on a novel by an Indian author. Although Dev Anand had refused, he took up the opportunity for a collaboration when he met Tad again at the 1962 Berlin Film Festival. Somebody suggested The Guide. Dev Anand purchased the book and read it at one go. He called up Pearl who invited him to the United States to discuss the project. With their approval, he called up R. K. Narayan and procured the rights to the book.[6]

Pearl tutored Waheeda Rehman on her diction for the English part. But due to differences of opinion between the two production teams, Anand postponed the Hindi version, thereby freeing Chetan Anand to direct Haqeeqat which was later highly acclaimed. It also became an opportunity for Vijay Anand who stepped in, as the film proved a landmark for him.[6][7]

The song, Aaj phir jeene ki tamanna hai which was picturised on Waheeda Rehman was shot in the Chittor Fort in Rajasthan.[5] The climax of the film was shot in Limdi town, 90 km from Ahmedabad as it has Bhogavo river which flows only during the monsoon. Chetan Anand was a classmate of erstwhile royals of Limbdi, Janaksinhji of Jhala family at Doon School in Dehradun, taught English at Limdi, in 1941.[8]

Factitious disorder imposed on self
17-21 minutes

For cases of feigned illness not driven by a psychiatric disorder, see Malingering.
Factitious disorder imposed on self
Other names	Munchausen syndrome[1]
Specialty	Psychology, Psychiatry

Factitious disorder imposed on self, also known as Munchausen syndrome, is a factitious disorder wherein those affected feign disease, illness, or psychological trauma to draw attention, sympathy, or reassurance to themselves. Munchausen syndrome fits within the subclass of factitious disorder with predominantly physical signs and symptoms, but patients also have a history of recurrent hospitalization, travelling, and dramatic, extremely improbable tales of their past experiences.[2] The condition derives its name from fictional character Baron Munchausen.

Factitious disorder imposed on self is related to factitious disorder imposed on another, which refers to the abuse of another person, typically a child, in order to seek attention or sympathy for the abuser. This drive to create symptoms for the victim can result in unnecessary and costly diagnostic or corrective procedures.[3]
Signs and symptoms[edit source]

In factitious disorder imposed on self, the affected person exaggerates or creates symptoms of illnesses in themselves to gain examination, treatment, attention, sympathy, and/or comfort from medical personnel. In some extreme cases, people suffering from Munchausen syndrome are highly knowledgeable about the practice of medicine and are able to produce symptoms that result in lengthy and costly medical analysis, prolonged hospital stays, and unnecessary operations. The role of "patient" is a familiar and comforting one, and it fills a psychological need in people with this syndrome. This disorder is distinct from hypochondriasis and other somatoform disorders in that those with the latter do not intentionally produce their somatic symptoms.[4] Factitious disorder is distinct from malingering in that people with factitious disorder imposed on self don't fabricate symptoms for material gain such as financial compensation, absence from work, or access to drugs.

The exact cause of factitious disorder is not known, but researchers believe both biological and psychological factors play a role in the development of this disorder. Risk factors for developing factitious disorder may include childhood traumas, growing up with parents/caretakers who were emotionally unavailable due to illness or emotional problems, a serious illness as a child, failed aspirations to work in the medical field, personality disorders, and low self-esteem. While there are no reliable statistics regarding the number of people in the United States who suffer from factitious disorder, FD is believed to be most common in mothers having the above risk factors. Those with a history of working in healthcare are also at greater risk of developing it.[5]

Arrhythmogenic Munchausen syndrome describes individuals who simulate or stimulate cardiac arrhythmias to gain medical attention.[6]

A similar behavior called factitious disorder imposed on another has been documented in the parent or guardian of a child. The adult ensures that his or her child will experience some medical affliction, therefore compelling the child to suffer through treatments and spend a significant portion during youth in hospitals. Furthermore, a disease may actually be initiated in the child by the parent or guardian. This condition is considered distinct from Munchausen syndrome. There is growing consensus in the pediatric community that this disorder should be renamed "medical abuse" to highlight the harm caused by the deception and to make it less likely that a perpetrator can use a psychiatric defense when harm is done.[7]
Diagnosis[edit source]

Due to the deceptive behaviors involved, diagnosing factitious disorder is very difficult. If the healthcare provider finds no physical reason for the symptoms, he or she may refer the person to a psychiatrist or psychologist (mental health professionals who are specially trained to diagnose and treat mental illnesses). Psychiatrists and psychologists use thorough history, physical examinations, laboratory tests, imagery, and psychological testing to evaluate a person for physical and mental conditions. Once the person's history has been thoroughly evaluated, diagnosing factitious disorder imposed on self requires a clinical assessment.[8] Clinicians should be aware that those presenting with symptoms (or persons reporting for that person) may malinger, and caution should be taken to ensure there is evidence for a diagnosis.[8] Lab tests may be required, including complete blood count (CBC), urine toxicology, drug levels from blood, cultures, coagulation tests, assays for thyroid function, or DNA typing. In some cases CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging, psychological testing, electroencephalography, or electrocardiography may also be employed.[8] A summary of more common and reported cases of factitious disorder (Munchausen syndrome), and the laboratory tests used to differentiate these from authentic disease is provided below:[9]
Disease Mimicked 	Method of Imitation 	Laboratory/Diagnostic Confirmation
Bartter’s syndrome 	

    Surreptitious intake of diuretics
    Self-induced vomiting

	

    High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of urine
    Urine chloride analysis

Catecholamine-secreting tumor 	Injection of epinephrine into urine or blood stream 	Adjunct analysis of increased Chromogranin A
Cushing’s syndrome 	Surreptitious steroid administration 	HPLC to differentiate endogenous and exogenous steroids
Hyperthyroid 	Surreptitious thyroxine administration 	Blood tests for free T4 and thyroid stimulating hormone
Hypoglycaemia 	Exogenous insulin or insulin secretagogues 	Simultaneous blood analysis of insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, and insulin secretagogues
Sodium imbalance 	Intake large quantities of salt 	Measure fractional sodium excretion to differentiate intentional salt overload from dehydration.
Chronic diarrhea 	

    Watered down stool samples
    Laxative abuse

	

    Measure fecal osmolarity
    Urine analysis to screen for laxatives using gas chromatography or mass spectrometry

Induced vomiting 	Although many alternatives possible, ipecacuanha ingestion 	HPLC measurement of serum or urine for elevated creatine kinase, transaminases and ipecacuanha
Proteinuria 	Egg protein injection into bladder, albumin (protein) addition to urine samples 	Urine protein electrophoresis analysis
Haematuria 	Blood introduction to urine samples, deliberate trauma to the urethra 	Imaging to rule out insertion of a foreign body, monitor sample collection, analysis of red blood cell shape in samples

There are several criteria that together may point to factitious disorder, including frequent hospitalizations, knowledge of several illnesses, frequently requesting medication such as pain killers, openness to extensive surgery, few or no visitors during hospitalizations, and exaggerated or fabricated stories about several medical problems. Factitious disorder should not be confused with hypochondria, as people with factitious disorder syndrome do not really believe they are sick; they only want to be sick, and thus fabricate the symptoms of an illness. It is also not the same as pretending to be sick for personal benefit such as being excused from work or school.[10]

People may fake their symptoms in multiple ways. Other than making up past medical histories and faking illnesses, people might inflict harm on themselves by consuming laxatives or other substances, self-inflicting injury to induce bleeding, and altering laboratory samples".[11] Many of these conditions do not have clearly observable or diagnostic symptoms and sometimes the syndrome will go undetected because patients will fabricate identities when visiting the hospital several times. Factitious disorder has several complications, as these people will go to great lengths to fake their illness. Severe health problems, serious injuries, loss of limbs or organs, and even death are possible complications.[medical citation needed]
Treatment[edit source]

Because there is uncertainty in treating suspected factitious disorder imposed on self, some advocate that health care providers first explicitly rule out the possibility that the person has another early-stage disease.[12] Then they may take a careful history and seek medical records to look for early deprivation, childhood abuse, or mental illness.[citation needed][8] If a person is at risk to themself, psychiatric hospitalization may be initiated.[13]

Healthcare providers may consider working with mental health specialists to help treat the underlying mood or disorder as well as to avoid countertransference.[14] Therapeutic and medical treatment may center on the underlying psychiatric disorder: a mood disorder, an anxiety disorder, or borderline personality disorder. The patient's prognosis depends upon the category under which the underlying disorder falls; depression and anxiety, for example, generally respond well to medication and/or cognitive behavioral therapy, whereas borderline personality disorder, like all personality disorders, is presumed to be pervasive and more stable over time,[15] and thus offers a worse prognosis.

People affected may have multiple scars on their abdomen due to repeated "emergency" operations.[16]
History[edit source]

The name "Munchausen syndrome" derives from Baron Munchausen, a literary character loosely based on the German nobleman Hieronymus Karl Friedrich, Freiherr von Münchhausen (1720–1797). The historical baron became a well-known storyteller in the late 18th century for entertaining dinner guests with tales about his adventures during the Russo-Turkish War. In 1785 German-born writer and con artist Rudolf Erich Raspe anonymously published a book in which a heavily fictionalized version of "Baron Munchausen" tells many fantastic and impossible stories about himself. Raspe's Munchausen became a sensation, establishing a literary exemplar of a bombastic liar or exaggerator.[17][18]

In 1951, Richard Asher was the first to describe a pattern of self-harm, wherein individuals fabricated histories, signs, and symptoms of illness. Remembering Baron Munchausen, Asher named this condition Munchausen's Syndrome in his article in The Lancet in February 1951,[19] quoted in his obituary in the British Medical Journal:

    "Here is described a common syndrome which most doctors have seen, but about which little has been written. Like the famous Baron von Munchausen, the persons affected have always travelled widely; and their stories, like those attributed to him, are both dramatic and untruthful. Accordingly the syndrome is respectfully dedicated to the Baron, and named after him."

    — British Medical Journal, R.A.J. Asher, M.D., F.R.C.P.[20]

Asher's nomenclature sparked some controversy, with medical authorities debating the appropriateness of the name for about fifty years. While Asher was praised for bringing cases of factitious disorder to light, participants in the debate objected variously that a literary allusion was inappropriate given the seriousness of the disease; that its use of the anglicized spelling "Munchausen" showed poor form; that the name linked the disease with the real-life Münchhausen, who did not have it; and that the name's connection to works of humor and fantasy, and to the essentially ridiculous character of the fictional Baron Munchausen, was disrespectful to patients suffering from the disorder.[21]

Originally, this term was used for all factitious disorders. Now, however, in the DSM-5, "Munchausen syndrome" and "Munchausen by proxy" have been replaced with "factitious disorder" and "factitious disorder by proxy" respectively.

Docker container benefits
https://www.infoworld.com/article/3310941/why-you-should-use-docker-and-containers.html

Containers work a little like VMs, but in a far more specific and granular way. They isolate a single application and its dependencies—all of the external software libraries the app requires to run—both from the underlying operating system and from other containers. All of the containerized apps share a single, common operating system (either Linux or Windows), but they are compartmentalized from one another and from the system at large.

Author Notes:
* Docker containers encapsulate everything an application needs to run (and only those things)
* Docker containers, unlike VMs, share a common operating system e.g. Linux or Windows
* They are compartmentalized from one another
* They allow applications to be shuttled easily between environments: Any host with the Docker runtime installed—be it a developer’s laptop or a public cloud instance—can run a Docker container
* Docker shines for microservices architecture
* What docker container doesn't provide
	* Don't offer extra security: Containers can add a layer of security to an app, but only as part of a general program of securing an app in context.
	* Docker doesn’t turn applications magically into microservices
	* Docker isn’t a substitute for virtual machines:  If you’re in an industry with heavy regulatory requirements, for instance, you might not be able to swap containers for VMs, because VMs provide more isolation than containers.

nstall Docker Engine on Ubuntu
Estimated reading time: 11 minutes

To get started with Docker Engine on Ubuntu, make sure you meet the prerequisites, then install Docker.
Prerequisites
OS requirements

To install Docker Engine, you need the 64-bit version of one of these Ubuntu versions:

    Ubuntu Focal 20.04 (LTS)
    Ubuntu Eoan 19.10
    Ubuntu Bionic 18.04 (LTS)
    Ubuntu Xenial 16.04 (LTS)

Docker Engine is supported on x86_64 (or amd64), armhf, and arm64 architectures.
Uninstall old versions

Older versions of Docker were called docker, docker.io, or docker-engine. If these are installed, uninstall them:

$ sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc

It’s OK if apt-get reports that none of these packages are installed.

The contents of /var/lib/docker/, including images, containers, volumes, and networks, are preserved. The Docker Engine package is now called docker-ce.
Supported storage drivers

Docker Engine on Ubuntu supports overlay2, aufs and btrfs storage drivers.

Docker Engine uses the overlay2 storage driver by default. If you need to use aufs instead, you need to configure it manually. See use the AUFS storage driver
Installation methods

You can install Docker Engine in different ways, depending on your needs:

    Most users set up Docker’s repositories and install from them, for ease of installation and upgrade tasks. This is the recommended approach.

    Some users download the DEB package and install it manually and manage upgrades completely manually. This is useful in situations such as installing Docker on air-gapped systems with no access to the internet.

    In testing and development environments, some users choose to use automated convenience scripts to install Docker.

Install using the repository

Before you install Docker Engine for the first time on a new host machine, you need to set up the Docker repository. Afterward, you can install and update Docker from the repository.
Set up the repository

    Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:

    $ sudo apt-get update

    $ sudo apt-get install \
        apt-transport-https \
        ca-certificates \
        curl \
        gnupg-agent \
        software-properties-common

    Add Docker’s official GPG key:

    $ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

    Verify that you now have the key with the fingerprint 9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A  E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88, by searching for the last 8 characters of the fingerprint.

    $ sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88

    pub   rsa4096 2017-02-22 [SCEA]
          9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A  E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88
    uid           [ unknown] Docker Release (CE deb) <docker@docker.com>
    sub   rsa4096 2017-02-22 [S]

    Use the following command to set up the stable repository. To add the nightly or test repository, add the word nightly or test (or both) after the word stable in the commands below. Learn about nightly and test channels.

        Note: The lsb_release -cs sub-command below returns the name of your Ubuntu distribution, such as xenial. Sometimes, in a distribution like Linux Mint, you might need to change $(lsb_release -cs) to your parent Ubuntu distribution. For example, if you are using Linux Mint Tessa, you could use bionic. Docker does not offer any guarantees on untested and unsupported Ubuntu distributions.

        x86_64 / amd64
        armhf
        arm64

    $ sudo add-apt-repository \
       "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
       $(lsb_release -cs) \
       stable"

Install Docker Engine

    Update the apt package index, and install the latest version of Docker Engine and containerd, or go to the next step to install a specific version:

     $ sudo apt-get update
     $ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

        Got multiple Docker repositories?

        If you have multiple Docker repositories enabled, installing or updating without specifying a version in the apt-get install or apt-get update command always installs the highest possible version, which may not be appropriate for your stability needs.

    To install a specific version of Docker Engine, list the available versions in the repo, then select and install:

    a. List the versions available in your repo:

    $ apt-cache madison docker-ce

      docker-ce | 5:18.09.1~3-0~ubuntu-xenial | https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu  xenial/stable amd64 Packages
      docker-ce | 5:18.09.0~3-0~ubuntu-xenial | https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu  xenial/stable amd64 Packages
      docker-ce | 18.06.1~ce~3-0~ubuntu       | https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu  xenial/stable amd64 Packages
      docker-ce | 18.06.0~ce~3-0~ubuntu       | https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu  xenial/stable amd64 Packages
      ...

    b. Install a specific version using the version string from the second column, for example, 5:18.09.1~3-0~ubuntu-xenial.

    $ sudo apt-get install docker-ce=<VERSION_STRING> docker-ce-cli=<VERSION_STRING> containerd.io

    Verify that Docker Engine is installed correctly by running the hello-world image.

    $ sudo docker run hello-world

    This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints an informational message and exits.

Docker Engine is installed and running. The docker group is created but no users are added to it. You need to use sudo to run Docker commands. Continue to Linux postinstall to allow non-privileged users to run Docker commands and for other optional configuration steps.
Upgrade Docker Engine

To upgrade Docker Engine, first run sudo apt-get update, then follow the installation instructions, choosing the new version you want to install.

There are two depictions of the same woman in the above picture. I actually do not feel much inferior around the women of Category A. They usually belong to typical Indian conservative and orthodox environments. This is MY perception. Unfortunately, most girls/women I know belong from Category B. I am not able to be confident around them due to my frugal lifestyle, cheap possessions and unattractive physique. I have seen many Category B girls notice guys ("rich" guys as my father taught me) and hit it off with them. For some reason, they reciprocate with these guys but laugh at me. They would be friendly with that guy while not giving a single fuck about me. They would not mind starting a conversation with other guys while completely ignoring me.

I was browsing around in a mall one day and saw two girls (Category B) walking towards me. They glanced at me as we crossed each other. As soon they passed me, they started laughing. A little thought in my head said they were probably thinking – “Poor bastard, just looking around without buying anything. Such a cheap guy. Doesn’t fit in here, What the fuck is he doing in this mall?” That may or may not have been the case, who knows? Another time, I went to a restaurant to treat myself to a birthday dinner. As I entered the restaurant, the first thing I saw was a large group of Category B girls having a party of their own, all dressed nicely, looking rich and brandishing their iPhones. I did not stay there for another second. I ended up having my birthday dinner at a cheap, roadside restaurant where the other customers do not make me feel small on my birthday.

I still get the feeling that they are laughing at me, judging me, mocking me - “We're too good for you, you fat loser! We are richer! We have high standards! You are scum! You do not belong around us! We would rather die than make you a friend! We’d rather date an old senile man-frog than you, ugly fuck!” Is it a crime to expect a friendly gesture from a woman first, even for a guy like me? I have never had a female friend nor dated anyone and I wonder if I ever will.

Currently, I am living as a loner with minimal contact with the outside world. It does upset my work and my career but I see no other workaround to my problem other than those people acknowledging my existence and wanting to be with me. I actively avoid situations where I might run into those people like movies, restaurants, malls, etc.

Broad experience and expertise

The great programmers I have known either have mastered one tech language or have become adept with multiple tech languages. They already know what technology would be best for a project, and how to troubleshoot most problems. This is definitely the most common asset of a great programmer. Nothing beats exceptional skills and knowledge.

Exceptional communication and work ethics

Great programmers have the excellent ability to communicate problems, breaking it down to understandable concepts, and propose organised solutions. What many don’t realise is that communication is a fundamental skill anyone should master. Better communication skills will make it easier for you to express your ideas.

Constant learner

As the tech landscape constantly changes, developers who are great at their craft make an effort to be up-to-date with tech trends to keep their skills and knowledge sharp. This sets good programmers from great ones: always being eager to learn and improve.

Attentive to detail

Great programmers are keen to details. They double-check and scrutinize their code if it’s properly placed or if it works. You know you are getting good results with great developers.

Eager problem-solver

A great programmer does not let himself be overwhelmed, rather he accepts challenges and eagerly troubleshoots issues. These kinds of developers always have a “can-do” and positive attitude when faced with a problem.

Great task and time management skills

Great developers are highly dependable. They know how to estimate the amount of time needed to finish tasks and know how to deal with clients and team members for the projects success.

Creative

This is something great developers possess. It’s amazing how they can connect ideas and see the overlooked to solve problems. While most developers are born with it, others can still improve their creativity. Why not try ?

Both independent and a team player

Great developers are someone who can work with others and can finish tasks by themselves as well. Great developers offer their knowledge with others and encourage their team members to perform well. Both traits make a great developer flexible with working with various teams.

By Bobby Ghosh

“Gone to Gulf.” That phrase came up a lot in conversations among grown-ups that I overheard as a schoolboy in Kerala during the early 1980s. My father, who managed a lobster-export business in the port of Kochi, was constantly griping about workers who quit on short notice — or none at all — to take up jobs in the Gulf cities of Muscat, Doha or Jeddah.

His friends — executives in rubber or coffee plantations, officials in the state-run shipyard or port authority — had the same problem: a constant exodus of workers, most of them “gone to Gulf.”

The jobs there were usually menial, and Dad harrumphed about Keralites giving up a gig at an air-conditioned lobster-processing plant “to get roasted in the desert sun.” He was astonished when his secretary, a university graduate he had marked for a bright future in the company, gave it up for a job pumping gas in Sharjah.

But neither Dad nor his friends could compete with the salaries being offered in the Persian Gulf countries. In their helplessness, they took empty comfort in making dire predictions of the day when Arab employers, having built all the palaces they could want, would finally send the foolish young Keralites back home, to beg for their old jobs.

Instead, years later, my father would join the exodus, agreeing to manage a small shipyard near Dubai, lured by the prospect of a final payday before retirement. He was not amused when I suggested that he had been inspired by that promising young secretary and “gone to Gulf” himself.

Four decades on, the dark auguries of Dad and his friends are coming true for many Keralites in the Gulf: Their Arab employers are laying them off in large numbers. And not just them, or there. The coronavirus pandemic has been devastating for foreign workers everywhere.

The official numbers have yet to be reported, but it’s safe to say that so far thousands have died and millions have lost their jobs. The impact on their families back home has been doubly debilitating: The loss of income from abroad — often from the sole breadwinner in the family — comes at a time of acute local hardship.

For economies that depend on this foreign income, the outlook for 2020 is bleak. The World Bank expects a 20% plunge in remittances to low- and middle-income countries. This plunge would be the steepest in history, far exceeding the 5% dip after the 2009 global financial crisis. The pain will be felt acutely in Kerala, which has an unhealthy addiction to remittances, and has failed to create alternative opportunities for its labour force.

This loss of income is likely just the start of a long cycle of despair. It will be years before countries that employ large numbers of foreign workers fully recover from the economic damage caused by the pandemic. Even when they do, they will have less room for migrants. Fewer Keralites will have the opportunity to join the ranks of the “gone to Gulf,” with profound economic implications for their families and their state.

In the petrostates of the Arabian Peninsula, the post-pandemic economic downturn will add impetus to long-standing programs designed to replace foreign workers with locals. Authorities in six member-states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have for years been pressing employers — using catchphrases like “Saudization” and “Omanization” — to reduce their dependence on foreigners.

These initiatives have tended to wax and wane with the price of oil: When it is high, unemployed citizens can depend on generous government subsidies, allaying concerns about foreigners taking all the jobs. It helps that many of the jobs done by migrants are unattractive, menial and low-paying.

But years of low oil prices combined with the swelling ranks of unemployed locals have forced authorities to take localization programs more seriously. These programs are at the heart of ambitious economic and social reforms being pursued by new, young rulers like Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Qatar’s Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Oman’s Sultan Haitham bin Tariq Al Said.

This reformist zeal is bad news for countries at the other end of the migration chain. Since the fall in oil prices in 2014, remittances from the GCC have plateaued. (In the case of Saudi Arabia, they have fallen precipitously.)

This year, judging by the early indicators, they are projected to go off a cliff. Remittances from the United Arab Emirates to India are expected to drop 35% in the second quarter alone. The UAE is the GCC’s largest source of remittances, and India is their top recipient.

Indeed, India should have experienced a slowing of money flows over the past few years. It bucked the trend in large part due to massive flooding in Kerala in 2018 and 2019, which led to spikes in remittances as Keralites in the Gulf sent home larger-than-usual sums to help with relief and reconstruction.

But that streak is about to be snapped. Unlike previous natural disasters, the pandemic is depleting the flow of money from abroad.

Kerala, which has ancient ties to the Gulf, will likely feel the pinch more than other Indian states. It receives nearly a fifth of remittances to the country, most of it from the GCC, whose members are home to between 2 million and 2.5 million Keralites. Although the state government doesn’t publish annual remittance figures, they are thought to consistently account for over a third of Kerala’s GDP.

This dependence leaves the government of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan handicapped even as it grapples with the impact of the pandemic. Kerala was the first Indian state to record a case of Covid-19 — a student who had returned from university in Wuhan, the Chinese ground zero of the crisis. Vijayan, a Marxist who had won acclaim for his adroit administration during the floods in the previous two years, moved quickly to flatten the curve.

Now the pandemic is spiking again, in Kerala as well as across India. With a loss of state revenues due to the effects of the lockdown, Vijayan could really use another surge in remittances from the Gulf. But this time, it is the diaspora that is in distress, and he must deal with the plight of Keralites who are losing their livelihoods in the GCC as well as the anxieties of their families at home.

The state expects more than 5,00,000 Keralites to return, many of them in the special repatriation flights organized by the Indian government. This figure is almost certainly an underestimate. Many others will make the return journey months from now, as companies and governments cut more jobs in the Gulf. “It will be a long time before we know how many Keralites have come home,” says S. Irudaya Rajan, who researches migration and remittance flows at the Center for Development Studies in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala’s capital.

Speaking to me privately, some Kerala government officials say they are not especially alarmed about the localization efforts of the Gulf states. The demand for Kerala’s best and brightest, they say, will resume after the pandemic. Just because the authorities want jobs to be filled by locals doesn’t mean there are sufficient numbers of locals who can fill them.

But Shashi Tharoor, a member of parliament from the state, allows that business may never return to usual. “It’s not just about Arabs taking jobs, but the jobs themselves disappearing for good,” he says.

Junaid Ahmad, the World Bank’s country director in India, likens Kerala’s challenge to that of post-conflict countries, where governments must reintegrate former fighters into society, by training and providing them with economic opportunities. Vijayan has to do the same for the returning Keralites, Ahmad says, “but instead of working with a peace dividend, he has to do this despite a loss in remittances.”

What’s more, he has to do it under extreme pressure at a politically inopportune moment. Diaspora groups are a powerful lobbying force in the state, and Vijayan faces elections in less than a year.

The recalibration of Kerala’s remittance-dependent economy will take longer. The migration of Keralites to the Gulf began in the 1970s; it was already a steady stream when I was a schoolboy in Kochi. By the turn of the century, nearly 1.5 million Keralites lived and worked in the GCC.

Kerala was uniquely positioned to cater to the seemingly insatiable demand for foreign workers from the petrostates. A long maritime history had made Keralites culturally prone to seeking their fortune abroad, and a series of business-unfriendly governments, not all of Vijayan’s Marxist stripe, had prevented the development of a robust private sector at home. (The company that employed my father in Kochi had left Kerala before I finished high school.)

Kerala’s proud record for near-total literacy gave its citizens a leg-up over other Indians — not to mention Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and others — seeking jobs in the Gulf. Despite their better education, the overwhelming majority of Keralites did jobs that indeed required being “roasted in the desert sun,” as Dad put it. In the classic migration pattern, young men endured great physical hardship and forewent luxuries to save up, remit money home and bring over friends and relatives. The steady exodus allowed the state government to get away with its poor economic management; jobs in the Gulf made up for unemployment and remittances fueled consumption. The running joke was that Kerala had a “money-order economy.”

But the money coming from the GCC was rarely put to the most efficient use: Much of it went into personal consumption — families bought gold and property, built homes. Bungalows popped up in formerly poor villages throughout the state.

This spending yielded little employment outside the construction sector, and even there much of the work involved back-breaking labour, hardly in keeping with the aspirations of educated Keralites. In an ironic echo of migration patterns in the Gulf, Kerala began to attract low-cost labour from other Indian states. The remittances were never used to build a significant industrial base, or to develop an information-technology sector comparable to its neighbours. In the absence of a sizable private sector, “there were no other investment possibilities,” says Reuben Abraham, CEO of the IDFC Institute, a public-policy think tank.

Still the remittances kept growing. In time, Keralites began to climb the value chain abroad, from blue- to white-collar jobs, from construction to banking, insurance and other services. This ascent, in addition to the size of the settled diaspora, meant that although other Indian states sent more workers to the Gulf annually, Keralites were able to send more money home.

Now, Keralites risk becoming victims of their own success: It is those white-collar jobs that are most likely to be localized. “Saudis and Emiratis are not going to work on construction sites, says Rajeev Mangottil of VPS Healthcare, a large Keralite-owned company that runs a chain of hospitals in the GCC. “Foreigners who are working in offices are very vulnerable right now.”

Many tens of thousands have already lost jobs to the pandemic’s economic impact, and it may be months before an accurate count is available. Emirates, the Dubai-based airline and one of the UAE’s largest employers, will eventually trim 30,000 from its rolls. (Dubai, it is worth remembering, was already experiencing its fastest pace of job losses in a decade before the pandemic struck.) Unsurprisingly, hundreds of thousands of Indians have registered for special repatriation flights from the UAE.

Among Keralites who have lost white-collar jobs in Dubai, panic has set in. Few have any expectation of finding work back home, much less work that will sustain the lifestyle they enjoyed in the Gulf. “Those who have lost their jobs but have EMIs (equated monthly installments) to pay are stuck,” says Mangottil. “People are applying for jobs that pay half their previous salaries.” When hope is finally extinguished, they will swell the ranks of returnees to Kerala.

What awaits them allows for little optimism. Top state officials, already working flat out to contain the coronavirus spike, have not yet articulated a strategy for dealing with the returning migrants. The government has announced some self-employment schemes, involving small loans and subsidies. But these were conceived before the pandemic, when the returnees numbered in three or four digits, not six.

The glass-half-full view is that the returnees will bring world-class skills and reserves of experience not easily found in Kerala. S.D. Shibulal, co-founder of the tech giant Infosys and one of the state’s more successful entrepreneurs, reckons that a nascent knowledge industry “offers good opportunities for returnees to invest.”

Putting what the World Bank’s Ahmad calls the “skills dividend” to use, however, will be a challenge for a state where socialist policies and powerful unions have created a reputation for hostility toward business. Kerala ranks 21st among 29 states in the Indian government’s ease-of-doing-business rankings.

Changing that perception will require more than efficient management of natural calamities. Competition for investment is fierce among Indian states and will grow fiercer as investments shrink with a slowdown in the global economy. Even if returning Keralites feel inclined to invest in business, there’s no guarantee they will restrict themselves to their home state.

Some officials argue that it would be short-sighted to focus too much on the returnees and lose sight of Kerala’s competitive advantage in the global labour market. Exporting workers is what the state does best. If demand shrinks in the Gulf, it will eventually pop up elsewhere: It’s a matter of pointing the outflow of migrant Keralites in the right direction. Government energies, these officials argue, are better expended on ensuring that the next generation of leavers has the right skills to compete and succeed wherever opportunities arise.

Even before the pandemic, says Tharoor, “Kerala’s big question has always been, How do we get enough people working abroad and sending money home?” That question is now being asked by the governments of dozens of countries that depend on remittances. The past few months have made finding the answer much more urgent.

Directive Principle of State Policy

The Constitution lays down certain Directive Principles of State Policy, which though not justiciable, are 'fundamental in governance of the country', and it is the duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws. These lay down that the State shall strive to promote the welfare of people by securing and protecting as effectively as it may, a social order, in which justice-social, economic and political-shall form in all institutions of national life. The State shall direct its policy in such a manner as to secure the right of all men and women to an adequate means of livelihood, equal pay for equal work and within limits of its economic capacity and development, to make effective provision for securing the right to work, education and to public assistance in the event of unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement or other cases of undeserved want. The State shall also endeavour to secure to workers a living wage, humane conditions of work, a decent standard of life, and full involvement of workers in management of industries.

In the economic sphere, the State is to direct its policy in such a manner as to secure distribution of ownership and control of material resources of community to subserve the common good, and to ensure that operation of economic system does not result in concentration of wealth and means of production to common detriment.

Some of the other important directives relate to provision of opportunities and facilities for children to develop in a healthy manner; free and compulsory education for all children up to the age of 14; promotion of education and economic interests of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and other weaker sections; organisation of village panchayats; separation of judiciary from executive; promulgation of a uniform civil code for whole country; protection of national monuments; promotion of justice on a basis of equal opportunity; provision of free legal aid; protection and improvement of environment and safeguarding of forests and wildlife of the country; promotion of international peace and security; just and honourable relations between nations; respect for international law; treaty obligations; and settlement of international disputes by arbitration.

Is India a Welfare State?

Welfare state

Article 38 of the Indian Constitution reads: “The state shall strive to promote the welfare the people by securing and protecting as effectively as it may, a social order in which justice-social economic and political-shall pervade all institutions of national life.”

The Indian Constitution, through its Directive Principles of State Policy, set up a roadmap for India – a general direction which the framers of the Constitution had envisioned for India in the decades to come. While these Directive Principles are not enforceable by law, they are considered fundamental to the very spirit of the Constitution. The six Directive Principles, which span Articles 36 to 51, lay down the framework for a welfare, socialist state. Article 39A promises “equal justice and free legal aid” to all citizens of the country, while Article 46 states that “The State shall promote, with special care, the education and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people”.

But is India truly a welfare state, simply by virtue of the fact that it claims to be one? A welfare state is one in which the Government undertakes to take care of the poor and underprivileged sections of the society. But is this definition enough? Are not all democratic governments therefore welfare states? Is a failed welfare state still a welfare state?

Critics of India’s welfare state claims feel that simply trying (and, in the case of India, failing to a large extent) to uplift the impoverished and homeless does not make a country a welfare state. One need look no further than The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 (MNREGA) for proof of the shocking regularity with which welfare policies fail in India. Envisioned as an corruption free measure to provide 100 days of work to rural dwellers, the policy got itself entangled in a bureaucratic and logistical nightmare.

Further arguments which could be made in this regard stem from the severe lack of awareness which the general public suffers from as far as welfare policies are concerned. A well planned welfare policy is still a failure if the target audience knows nothing about it and is therefore unable to avail of it. A welfare state is therefore not one which merely rolls out welfare for the benefit of the people, but one where the people are actually benefited.

At the same time, however, an absolute welfare state is a utopian ideology which might never truly become a feasible reality. Even the Nordic and Scandinavian countries like Norway and Sweden which are today hailed as the ideal welfare state, are far from achieving total welfare. Moreover, a fact often overlooked with these countries is the relatively low populations they house (5.2 million and 9.9 million respectively as compared to India’s 1.4 billion), which makes life for the governments of these countries infinitely easier.

Proponents of India’s welfare claim draw from this line of reasoning to assert that welfare is not an absolute term, but a work in progress. While welfare policies in some countries might enjoy relatively higher levels of success than those in India, it is the very act of striving towards the ideal of welfare, and the Indian government’s attempts to realize their goals which make India a welfare state, such parties argue.

As far as attempts go, there is no dearth of policies which the Indian Government has implemented with an objective of welfare. The Sarva Siksha Abhiyan, the Beti Bachao Andolan, the establishment of public health units (PHU), the execution of vaccination campaigns, and the granting of oil and gas subsidies are all examples of such policies. While they might not have succeeded to the extent desired, each has managed, in some form or another, to contribute some kind of additional benefit to the people of India.

From the Government’s end as well, there exists a strong motivation to ensure that welfare policies succeed. A large part of India’s voting population is in dire need of monetary aid from the Government, and if the current government wishes to stay in power, it must do it’s best to see that all its policies are as successful as possible. As the Indian public gradually grows more weary of rhetoric and promises of “Achhe Din”, and more and more laymen are judging the government on the tangible benefits it has granted them rather than on the strength of its spokespersons’ speeches, the government will now have to do everything in its power to make good on its promises.

If we were to characterize the end here as the ruling government’s desire to stay in power, and the means to achieving that as the proper implementation of welfare policies, then selfish as the ends may be, the means here justify the ends. The means, in fact, are an end in themselves; the end of human development. This argument holds especially true if one considers the long term, where the government’s desire to stay in power become a means – a means to achieving the end of further governance in future, where welfare policies would once again need to be implemented with degrees of success tangible to the voting public. This leads to a virtuous circle of welfare for the public and good governance for the country.

In practical terms, however, India has a long way to go before it can truly free itself from the shackles of corruption and red-tape to ensure that the welfare policies are putting enough money in the right pockets.

Introduction

India is a welfare state. The fact that the preamble of the Constitution itself envisages India to be a ‘socialist’ state bears enough evidence for this.

What do we understand by the word socialism? Socialism in India is not understood in the Russian context where all resources are owned by the state and the state secures the welfare of all. Socialism, as envisioned in the Indian Constitution, aims at elimination of inequality in income, status and standards of life. In many decisions, courts have interpreted ‘socialism’ to mean a kind of social democracy which comes closer to the conception of a social welfare state as seen in the Constitutions of France and Germany. The Constitution itself, however, does not define the term, but merely implies the above meaning through the rest of its provisions.

In exercise of socialism, the Constitution provides what are called the Directive Principles of State Policy in Part four. These principles are not justiciable in a court of law, meaning that one cannot file a proceeding because a Directive Principle has not been enacted or been denied. However, this does not render them redundant as they recognize the long-term but fundamental goals of a welfare state which help in defining the path of development the country is to follow, and it is the duty of the State to apply them while making laws. By their very name, they are “Directive” principles, principles which help the government direct their functions in order to make India what the Constitution-makers wanted it to be. Further, Article 38 provides a mandate for the State to ‘secure a social order for the promotion of welfare of the people’.

Article 39 lays down six Directive Principles. Some of these are to ensure means of equal livelihood to men and women, ownership and control of resources be distributed to serve the best interests of the people, there is no concentration of wealth, there is equal pay for equal work of men and women, etc.

Article 39A, inserted by the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act of 1976, imposes a mandate on the state to provide equal justice and free legal aid. This particular provision shall be the focus of this project, as the questions to which we seek answers are:

        Whether free legal aid is meant to achieve speedy and equal justice.
        Does it achieve this aim.

The answers may be arrived at by attempting to inquire into the following questions:

    What exactly does Article 39A provide for?
    If it is not enforceable, what is the legal value of this provision?
    What has been the position of courts regarding Article 39A? What do the judgments lay down?
    So does Article 39A, along with decided cases, provide a way to ensure speedy and equal justice by way of free legal aid?
    If yes, how is this implemented? Is it effective or does it only seem theoretically sound but practically unsound?

In this project report, the chapter plan shall be as follows:

Chapter 1 shall discuss Article 39A in detail. Along with this, its legal weight shall be discussed, in spite of it being not enforceable.

Chapter 2 shall discuss the judgments of courts in this regard and the positions of law they have decided upon with respect to Article 39A.

Chapter 3 shall discuss if free legal aid is capable of accomplishing speedy and equal justice.

Chapter 4 shall analyze whether this possibility is being practically implemented properly.

The researcher hopes that through the following research, answers to the research questions and hence to the main question may be arrived at satisfactorily.
Scope And Enforceability

Article 39A states:

“39A. Equal justice and free legal aid – The State shall secure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice, on a basis of equal opportunity, and shall, in particular, provide free legal aid, by suitable legislation or schemes or in any other way, to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reason of economic or other disabilities.”

The Article implies that free legal service is inalienable from the requirements of reasonable, fair and just, as without it people would suffer economic disabilities, which cannot be a ground for someone not getting access to justice. This should be held to be implicit in Article 21, that is, the fundamental right to life and personal liberty.

Article 21 states:

“21. Protection of life and personal liberty – No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.”

When Article 21 and 39A are read together, it becomes quite clear that equal justice required in the latter is included within life and liberty of the former. 39A further gives the State a way to ensure that this Fundamental Right of the accused is not infringed, that is by provision of free legal aid and opportunity. This was stated in Maneka Gandhi v Union of India.

So although Article 39A is not enforceable in a court of law by virtue of it being a Directive Principle, it may draw its mandate from Article 21. That is, in fact, how the various cases regarding free legal aid have come up in the courts.

The State must provide services of a lawyer to the accused if the he or she is incapable of securing one on their own and if the circumstance demands it. This they must do to secure their credibility by virtue of being a socialist state. When the enjoyment of justice becomes a right only of the rich and is denied to the poor, the threat to democracy becomes a real one because the existence of a democracy depends on the belief of the people in its efficiency. It also defeats the Preambular requirements of economic justice and equality of status and opportunity.

In pursuance of Article 39A, the Parliament enacted the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987. Enforceability can also be derived from this act. The further provisions of this act shall be discussed in the subsequent sections.
Position Of Courts On Article 39A

Petitions invoking Article 39A have come up many a time in courts of law. Most of these seek maintainability through Article 21 as 39A is not enforceable. In this chapter, a series of the main decisions shall be discussed.

The first of these judgments is a 1978 decision of the Supreme Court in Madhav Hayawadanrao Hoskot v State of Maharashtra. The case came up as a Special Leave Petition by the accused, M.H. Hoskot, who was charged with forgery and misrepresentation of a college degree. The shopkeeper to whom he went for getting a fake seal made, however, turned out to be clever and he gave pre-emptive information to the police. The Sessions court held the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt for grave offences, but softened his punishment to a large degree. This gave rise to two appeals to the High Court: one by the Petitioner against the conviction and the other by the Respondents for the nominal punishment. High Court dismissed the Petitioner’s appeal and allowed the Repondent’s, increasing the punishment to three years rigorous imprisonment. The appeal in the Supreme Court came up against this harsh punishment, but after a period of four years. The reasons stated by the Petitioner for this delay was that a copy of the High Court had not been served to him. The Supreme Court identified to perils of the legal system in this: first, the fact that prisoners are at the mercy of the prison officials with regard to their right to appeal; second, there is no statutory provision for free legal serives to a prisoner because of which a right of appeal for the legal illiterates is nugatory and, therefore, a negation of that fair legal procedure which is implicit in Article 21 of the Constitution as was stated in the Maneka Gandhi case. Though the Supreme Court provided the petitioner a lawyer, he decided to argue on his own.

The Court in its judgment categorically stated that the provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure granting Right to Appeal was implicit in Article 21 of the Constitution. It could not be denied under any circumstances and it is the duty of courts to facilitate an accused invoking this right. It further states that Article 39A is an ‘interpretive tool’ for Article 21. It affirms the position in Maneka Gandhi v Union of India that personal liberty could not be cut down without fair legal procedure. To ensure this was a State’s duty and not any form of charity. Further, though the services were to be free to the beneficiary, the lawyer had to be remunerated at the State’s cost.

The decree of the High Court was not changed. The Supreme Court only laid down the said principles. But it confined this liberty to a prisoner alone.

The decision that came after this was Hussainara Khatoon v Home Secretary, State of Bihar. The case came up to the court by writ petition on account of counter-affidavits filed by respondents pursuant to directions given by the same court on 26th February, 1979. In the directions, state of Bihar was required to file a revised chart of all under-trial prisoners, categorizing them between major and minor offences, which had not been carried out. But respondents in affidavits assured that the procedure was under way.

It was found from lists of under-trial prisoners filed by the state that many of the prisoners had been kept in jail longer than the maximum period for which they could be sentenced, if convicted. These convicts were to be released with immediate effect as further detention would be illegal and violative of Article 21.

It was further discovered that many prisoners, charged for bailable offences, were still in jail because no application for bail had been made, or they were to poor to furnish it. This could be because of their inability to avail a lawyer who could avail their right to bail for them. The Court thinks such a situation signifies a desperate needed for an appropriate legal service program, but nothing has been done in this context so far. It affirmed Maneka Gandhi v Union of India and MH Hoskot v State of Maharashtra.

The court strongly recommended to government that it was high time to get a comprehensive legal service program into the country which would ensure not only the mandates of stretched interpretations of art 14 (equal justice) and art 21 (life and liberty), but also compulsion embodied in 39A. Also, for an accused unable to get representation, it was a constitutional right that he may demand from the state. If the state fails to provide such machinery, it amounts to a denial of liberty under 21. Also, trial itself may be vitiated solely because article 21 is being denied to the accused.

In Khatri v State of Bihar, affidavits were filed by the Respondents including particulars of the Bhagalpur Central Jail. One of the issues discussed here was that the blinded prisoners brought before the Judicial Magistrates were not provided legal representation. The reason given was that none of them asked for representation.

The court stated that this was a gross violation of the principles established by the apex court in Hussainara Khatoon case.

It further states that the constitutional obligation to provide free legal services to an indigent accused does not arise only when the trial commences but also attaches when the accused is for the first time produced before the magistrate. It is elementary that the jeopardy to his personal liberty arises as soon as a person is arrested.

The exercise of this right is not conditional on the accused asking for assistance. The magistrate or sessions court before which accused appears has the obligation to inform the accused of his right to avail free legal services if he is unable to afford it.

In Sukh Das v Union Territory of Arunachal Pradesh, it was settled that free legal assistance at the State’s cost is a fundamental right of the accused if the offence is such that it may involve jeopardy to his life or personal liberty. This is implicit in the requirement of reasonable, fair and just procedure prescribed by Article 21.

But this leads to a question: what about cases involving economic offences or offences against laws prohibiting child abuse or prostitution? Here social justice may require that accused is not provided free legal aid. But it may be argued here that the maxim ‘innocent till proven guilty’ should apply. If one assumes the accused to be innocent till it is shown that he is guilty, till that point the accused must be provided full rights.

In Centre for legal research v State of Kerala, the question was whether voluntary organizations or social action groups engaged in legal aid programs should be supported by the state government, and if yes, then till what extent? CJ Bhagwati said that legal service was not a charity but a social entitlement of the people. Those in need of assistance were not mere beneficiaries but participants in the entire process. Voluntary organizations and social action groups engaged in legal aid programs were the best way to ensure participation of the people. These organizations, because of the specialized nature of their functions, are well-versed with the people and their needs. Thus they must be encouraged and supported by the State. But they shall not be under control or direction of the State.

In the most recent case on this point, State of Maharashtra v Manubhai Pragaji Vashi, the particular question of grants-in-aid to non-governmental law colleges was dealt with. It was held that provision of grants was duty of State which came out of reading of Article 39A with 21. It also affirmed the position of Supreme Court in the previous cases.

This is the present view of the apex court on this issue.
Is Free Legal Aid Capable Of Achieving Speedy And Equal Justice?

The requirement of equal justice is mandated in the Preamble of our Constitution in the words ‘equality of status and opportunity’. This is manifested in Article 14 under part three that deals with Fundamental Rights.

Article 14 guarantees the right to equality in the following words:

“14. Equality before law – The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.”

Interpreting these two provisions, it is evident how the requirement of equal justice is manifested in the Constitution.

Article 14 has been interpreted in various ways. The ‘new rule’ in this regard was laid down by J. Bhagwati in EP Royappa v State of Tamil Nadu, and reiterated in the Maneka Gandhi Case. He said that Article 14 strikes at arbitrariness in State action and ensures fairness and equality of treatment. State action must not be guided by any extraneous or the relevant considerations because that would be a denial of equality.

This means that the aim is to provide opportunities to those who lack them, but with a reasonable cause, and without arbitrariness.

In this situation, there is a reasonable cause. The cause is provision of legal representation to persons who cannot avail it. This is reasonable as without representation, an accused cannot defend himself fairly in a court of law. Such a person may be convicted merely because he could not seek protection of the law and not because he was guilty. Our criminal justice system is based on the principle of innocent until proven guilty. This is a tool to ensure that nobody who is innocent is made to suffer. In such a system, is it not unfair to convict a person merely because he is not bestowed enough to seek protection under the law? Also, such a provision is in no way arbitrary. It merely seeks to provide to a disadvantaged class of persons an opportunity by which they can be placed on an equal plane with those who are wealthy enough.

Thus it is submitted that free legal aid is expedient in achieving equal justice.
Is Speedy And Equal Justice Through Free Legal Aid Actually Being Achieved?

In this chapter, we shall be analyze the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 and its impact.

The Act was enacted to constitute legal services authorities for providing free and competent legal services to the weaker sections of the society, to ensure that opportunities for securing justice were not denied to any citizen by reason of economic or other disabilities and to organize Lok Adalats to ensure that the operation of the legal system promoted justice on a basis of equal opportunity.

However, a major drawback in the existing scheme of organization of the Lok Adalats under that Act is that the system of Lok Adalats is mainly based on compromise or settlement between the parties. If the parties do not arrive at any compromise or settlement, the case is either returned to the court of law or the parties are advised to seek remedy in a court of law. This causes unnecessary delay in the dispensation of justice. If Lok Adalats are given power to decide the cases on merit when parties fails to arrive at any compromise, this problem can be tackled to a great extent.

Further, cases which arise in relation to public utility services such as Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited, Delhi Vidyut Board, etc., need to be settled urgently so that people get justice without delay even at pre-litigation stage and thus most of the petty cases which ought not to go in the regular courts would be settled at the pre-litigation stage itself which would result in reducing the workload of the regular courts to a great extent.

It was, therefore, proposed to amend the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 to set up Permanent Lok Adalats for providing compulsory pre-litigative mechanism for conciliation and settlement of cases relating to public utility services.

This amendment was implemented at a later date. It sought to do away with the problems mentioned above. However, though the law now provided, implementation was lacking to a large extent.

Justice Krishna Iyer criticized the Act saying that at times such Adalats solved disputes not by relying on established legal principles but with aims like ending feuds, securing peace to the family, etc. Although these goals are to be kept in mind, such goals are only peripheral and not cardinal, they do not deal with the core issues.
Conclusion & Suggestions

As a conclusion to this project report, I would like to lay down the following observations.

        Although Article 39A is a directive principle and so is not enforceable per se, it still derives its enforceability from Article 21 and the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987.
        The series of judgments by the Supreme Court dealing with this issue concur in their view that free legal aid is a fundamental right of the accused under Article 21 and cannot be denied. It is the duty of the State to ensure that justice is imparted equally and in furtherance of this, Magistrates and Sessions Courts (starting points of trials) have the onus of informing the accused of their right to legal service, and it is no excuse to say that the accused did not ask the court for assistance in representation. The State’s duty also extends to funding of voluntary organizations and social groups that promote legal services to the deprived in order to ensure that the aim of Article 39A is achieved.
        Free legal aid helps achieve the aim of equal justice by rationale of the Preamble and Article 14 (equality before the law) by placing all accused on an equal footing and making sure nobody is disadvantaged due to their economic position.
        The legalization of this provision happened in 1987 by way of the Legal Services Authorities Act. Many problems were identified herein, some of them being that in the imparting of justice, legal principles were overshadowed by social aims like restoring peace to the family, no matter at what cost. These were amended. This made the law somewhat sound in theory. Its practice, however, is another story.

In the light of these observations, I would like to put forth the following suggestions:

        There should be some degree of accountability in the Constitution wherein courts are held responsible for the dispensation of equal justice by periodical review. If every time that an accused is denied an equal opportunity, he has to file a fresh case, it would hamper the working of the judicial system.
        People generally should be educated about their rights under a judicial system. If this is done, they would be more aware and would not need guidance. Also, they would know what protection to invoke in their defence and would be aware of their options. They would not be hard done by solely due to their ignorance.

Based on the conclusions arrived at, if the said suggestions are implemented, the society would see a brighter day where justice is not denied to one solely because of their financial incapabilities. If such a day comes, it could be said safely that we would have achieved at least part of the vision our forefathers saw as the India of the future.

With this I would like to conclude this project report.

How did Elon Musk become so successful?

Elon became so successful because of his obsessive-compulsive personality.

    When he was 11, he taught himself coding. This took time and effort and lots of perseverance. I believe this insane feat is often overlooked - I have tried to code (being taught) and I gave up after a few days. I'm 16.
    Throughout his childhood, he read avidly and in abnormal quantities. In my experience, this does not take perseverance - reading is fun and highly rewarding - but it takes a certain type to read most waking moments of the day.
    When he was at University, he took masses of subjects - Two Masters and progressing to Stanford for a PhD. This takes hundred of intense and dedicated hours of work.
    He had control. While his housemate was the personification of the party, he stayed sober. And because of this, made a killing at the door selling tickets, paying for his rent, his college fees and many more - ultimately funding Zip2. This is often overlooked, because at this point, had he drunk excessively, he would not likely have had the money to persuade his father to invest in his first startup. Sobreity is the key to success…

I saw many people in my life who were in denial of toxic and abusive families and the evils that they may support due to conditioning or their belief in them. We treat parents as God, while forgetting that there are many families which have toxic parents, and due to that upbringing, the children end up becoming under confident, docile, and many end up being abusive, because they see that from their childhood, and think this is the right way of treating other people. Many children and adults are scarred for life, and need therapy to overcome the effects. It's time that we all stop treating families and even parents as Gods, and treat them as human beings who are not infallible, just like we are not. Stop calling people who say that their families have evil practices as woke, and maybe try to understand their point as well.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosuo_women
The Mosuo (Chinese: 摩梭; pinyin: Mósuō) are a small ethnic group living in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces in China, close to the border with Tibet. Dubbed the 'Kingdom of Women' by the Chinese,[1]:2 the Mosuo population of about 50,000 live near Lugu Lake in the Tibetan Himalayas 27°42′35.30″N 100°47′4.04″E﻿ / ﻿27.7098056°N 100.7844556°E. 

Scholars use diverse terms and spellings to designate the Mosuo culture. Most prefer 'Mosuo' some spell it 'Moso', while a minority use neither term, but refer to them as the Na people. 

The Mosuo people are known as the 'Kingdom of Women' because the Na are a matrilineal society: heterosexual activity occurs only by mutual consent and mostly through the custom of the secret nocturnal 'visit';[2] men and women are free to have multiple partners,[2] and to initiate or break off relationships when they please.

The origin of matrilineality and matriarchy

Matrilineal cultures trace descent through the female line. It can also be considered a society in which one identifies with one's mother's lineage including familial lineage or property inheritance.

Matriarchal cultures are run by women. Women hold primary power, predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property at the specific exclusion of men, at least to a large degree. 

Historically the Mosuo lived in a feudal system where a larger peasant population was controlled by a small nobility. The nobility was afraid of the peasant class gaining power. Since leadership was hereditary, the peasant class was given a matriarchal system. This prevented threats to nobility power by having the peasant class trace lineage through the female line. This system has led to numerous distinct traits among Mosuo society.

Vertical axis wind turbine
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_axis_wind_turbine

A vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWT) is a type of wind turbine where the main rotor shaft is set transverse to the wind (but not necessarily vertically) while the main components are located at the base of the turbine. This arrangement allows the generator and gearbox to be located close to the ground, facilitating service and repair. VAWTs do not need to be pointed into the wind,[1][2] which removes the need for wind-sensing and orientation mechanisms. Major drawbacks for the early designs (Savonius, Darrieus and giromill) included the significant torque variation or "ripple" during each revolution, and the large bending moments on the blades. Later designs addressed the torque ripple issue by sweeping the blades helically (Gorlov type).[3]

A vertical axis wind turbine has its axis perpendicular to the wind streamlines and vertical to the ground. A more general term that includes this option is "transverse axis wind turbine" or "cross-flow wind turbine." For example, the original Darrieus patent, US Patent 1835018, includes both options.

Drag-type VAWTs such as the Savonius rotor typically operate at lower tipspeed ratios than lift-based VAWTs such as Darrieus rotors and cycloturbines. 

Disadvantages
    One of the major outstanding challenges facing vertical axis wind turbine technology is dynamic stall of the blades as the angle of attack varies rapidly.[11][12][13]

    The blades of a VAWT are fatigue-prone due to the wide variation in applied forces during each rotation. This can be overcome by the use of modern composite materials and improvements in design - including the use of aerodynamic wing tips that cause the spreader wing connections to have a static load. The vertically oriented blades can twist and bend during each turn, causing them to break apart.

    VAWTs have proven less reliable than HAWTs,[14] although modern designs of VAWTs have overcome many of the issues associated with early designs.[15][16] 

Advantages: VAWTs offer a number of advantages over traditional horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWTs):

    Being omni-directional, some forms do not need to track the wind. This means they don't require a complex mechanism and motors to yaw the rotor and pitch the blades.[8]
    VAWTs generally function better than HAWTs in turbulent and gusty winds. HAWTs cannot efficiently harvest such winds, which also cause accelerated fatigue.
    the gearbox of a VAWT takes much less fatigue than that of a HAWT.[citation needed]
    In VAWTs, gearbox replacement and maintenance are simpler and more efficient, as the gearbox is accessible at ground level, so that no cranes or other large equipment are needed on-site. This reduces costs and impact on the environment. Motor and gearbox failures generally are significant considerations in the operation and maintenance of HAWTs both on and offshore.
    some designs of VAWTs in suitable situations can use screw pile foundations, which hugely reduces the road transport of concrete and the carbon cost of installation. Screw piles can be fully recycled at the end of their life.
    wings of the Darrieus type have a constant chord and so are easier to manufacture than the blades of a HAWT, which have a much more complex shape and structure.
    VAWTs can be grouped more closely in wind farms, increasing the generated power per unit of land area.
    VAWTs can be installed on HAWT wind farm below the existing HAWTs; this can supplement the power output of the existing farm.[9]
    research at Caltech has also shown that a carefully designed wind farm using VAWTs can have an output power ten times that of a HAWT wind farm of the same size.[10]

Darrieus wind turbine
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darrieus_wind_turbine

The Darrieus wind turbine is a type of vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) used to generate electricity from wind energy. The turbine consists of a number of curved aerofoil blades mounted on a rotating shaft or framework. The curvature of the blades allows the blade to be stressed only in tension at high rotating speeds. There are several closely related wind turbines that use straight blades. This design of the turbine was patented by Georges Jean Marie Darrieus, a French aeronautical engineer; filing for the patent was October 1, 1926. There are major difficulties in protecting the Darrieus turbine from extreme wind conditions and in making it self-starting. 

There are Combined Darrieus–Savonius generator used in Taiwan.

☺
Savonius wind turbine
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savonius_wind_turbine
Savonius wind turbines are a type of vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT), used for converting the force of the wind into torque on a rotating shaft. The turbine consists of a number of aerofoils, usually—but not always—vertically mounted on a rotating shaft or framework, either ground stationed or tethered in airborne systems. 

-  Because they are drag-type devices, Savonius turbines extract much less of the wind's power than other similarly-sized lift-type turbines. 
- Much of the swept area of a Savonius rotor may be near the ground, if it has a small mount without an extended post, making the overall energy extraction less effective due to the lower wind speeds found at lower heights. 

- Savonius turbines are used whenever cost or reliability is much more important than efficiency. Most anemometers are Savonius turbines for this reason, as efficiency is irrelevant to the application of measuring wind speed.

The Gorlov helical turbine (GHT) is a water turbine evolved from the Darrieus turbine design by altering it to have helical blades/foils. It was patented in a series of patents from September 19, 1995[1] to July 3, 2001[2] and won 2001 ASME Thomas A. Edison Patent Award. GHT was invented by Alexander M. Gorlov, professor of Northeastern University.

The Tech That Could Fix One of Wind Power's Biggest Problems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wlxz-KzebbQ

Hello World’s Ashlee Vance paid a recent visit to Iceland’s capital city of Reykjavik to see the next part of the green energy story. He found a start-up called Icewind that is building a new type of funky wind turbine designed to perform well in low-wind conditions but also to slow itself down in high-winds, preventing it from catching on fire or ripping apart.

"icewind" revamps the wind turbine with a sleek and sculptural aesthetic
ults
Key Words:
- vertical axis wind turbines
- ac wind turbine
- tubular wind turbine
- high speed wind turbine
- o-wind turbine

Wind turbines get a lot of bad press for their aesthetic impact on natural landscapes, and icelandic startup icewind has set out to turn the traditional turbine into a thing of beauty. Icewind’s designs use a more horizontal structure, flipping the traditional blades on their side and widening the surface area. the resulting machines are neat and sculptural, with increased functionality that allows them to catch wind from any direction.

- The Icewind turbine is designed to elegantly blend in with the environment.
- The stainless steel curves give the machine a sculptural look
- The turbine automatically slows itself down in higher winds to prevent the machines catching on fire.
- The icewind turbines are based on ancient Persian technology, giving the age-old concept an update for the 21st century. each one is hand made in iceland from stainless steel, carbon fiber and aircraft grade aluminum.
- The machines are designed to elegantly blend into the environment, not affecting bird life and operating with next to no noise. production range is wide—meaning that the turbines function in extremely low (under 2 m/s) and high, hurricane-strength winds (over 50 m/s).
- The artistic turbines can be built as both large, standalone structures like the CW-1000 or as the Icewind RW—a smaller, stackable version that can be discretely placed atop telecom and surveillance towers. Icewind also trialed their smaller RW turbines on top of a bus stop in reykjavic, using the energy generated to power a WIFI router, an advertising board, and a phone recharging station. the company aims to make wind-power accessible as a personal choice, so their turbines are designed for residental application, providing power or heading to individual homes or farms. coupled with a small heat pump, the larger wind turbine can sully supply an average-sized cabin with heating and power.

Deep work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZD7dXfdDPfg
Deep work: as described by Cal himself, deep work is professional activity performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that pushes your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate. 
One to two hours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, can produce a lot of valuable output.
As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill of going deep, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.

There is a way to incorporate deep work and escape the constant distraction. Here are a few strategies you can use:

1. The easiest way to start deep work sessions is to transform them in to a regular habit. Set a time and a quiet location used for your deep tasks each day.
    - The amount of will power is limited
    - You must add routines and rituals to your working life to design to minimize the amount of (limited) will power necessary to transition yourself into a state of unbroken concentration
    - For a novice, somewhere around 1 hour a day of intense concentration seems to be the limit, while for experts this number can expand to as many as four hours.
    - Deep work is best practices early in the morning, typically at the time when you've no distractions.
2. Allow yourself to be lazy.
    - Regularly resting your brain improves the quality of deep work.
    - So when you work, work hard.
    - But when you're done, be done.
    - Another "key commitment" to succeed is to create a "shut down ritual".
    - Only the confidence that you're done until the next day can convince your brain to down-shift to the level where it can begin to recharge for the next day.
    - Put in other words: Trying to squeeze a little more work out of your evenings, might reduce your effectiveness the next day enough that you end up getting less done, instead if you had respected a "shut down".
3. Schedule in advance when you'll use the Internet, and then avoid it altogether outside of these times.
    - Write it down on a notepad and record the next time you're allowed to go online.
    - Until you arrive at that time, absolutely, no network connectivity is allowed no matter how tempting.
    - The point is, we increasingly recognize that these tools fragment our time and reduce our ability to concentrate.
    - This is especially dangerous after the work-day is over, where the freedom in your schedule enables internet to become central to your leisure time.
    - Such behavior is dangerous because it weakens your mind's general ability to resist distraction.
    - This makes deep work difficult when you really want to concentrate.
    - In other words: When it comes to relaxation, don't default to whatever catches your attention at the moment.
    - So, instead, dedicate some advanced thinking to how you want to spend your free time.

Cal Newport: "Follow Your Passion" Is Bad Advice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMu1PGbG-0
- We go from the "philosophical" towards the more practical.
-   So, we'll begin with the sort of contrarian hair raising ideas and it will end up with the sort of concrete habits that you could actually put into practice tomorrow to get more out of your working life.

The late Steve Jobs as my example for my first big idea: You've got to find what you love. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking and don't settle.
    - People often equate this statement to "Follow your passion".
    - People getting a lot excited about this particular idea emphasizes something what Cal Newport has found time and again when he has been researching the issue (with concentration) and that's the fact that "American culture" is obsessed with this idea that the only way to end up happy in what you do for a living is to follow your passion.
    - But there is also a problem here: In addition to being an astonishingly popular piece of advice, "follow your passion" is also an astonishingly a bad piece of advice. 
    - Newport's Law: Telling a person to follow their passion reduces the probability they'll end up passionate.
    - What Newport argues here is:
        - That the specific strategy of identifying a "pre-existing passion" and then following it, is a bad strategy for achieving that goal. 
        - People often tend to pick passions that are no where related to the careers they pick.
        - The second problem that your passion presupposes is: If you really like something and match that to your job, you will then on out have a sort of long-term and engaging and meaningful career.
        - This is an incredibly "simplistic and reductive" understanding of workplace satisfaction.
        - Look no further than passionate amateur photographers or bakers that end up miserable and overworked when they open their photography studio or bakery.
        - The most ironic example of the insufficiency of this advice is Steve Jobs himself.
        - Even though, Steve Jobs stood on that stage in 2005 and said what people at least interpreted the meaning of "follow your passion", his biographers make it clear that it is not at all what he did. In the period leading upto Apple Computers, Steve Jobs did not have an unusual passion for technology entrepreneurship. Apple was something that he stumbled into. One of his biographers put it - Apple was a small-time scheme that unexpectedly took off. But nobody doubts Steve Jobs ended up quite passionate about what he did for a living.
        - What tells us the lesson here is that it's not how you get started that matters. May be what matters is what you do once you get going.

2nd Idea
- Celebrated Environmental writer Bill McKibben, he is someone who loves what he does for a living. He is a full time writer, may be one or two times every three years.
- He systematically built his skill over 10 years and used those skills to take control of his working life and shifted in directions that resonated with him.
- People who succeed, they build a rare and valueable skill systematically and then, use it as leverage.
- Summary: You can not expect a good working life unless you're really good at something.

Newport's law of 'The Argument from Pre-Existing Passion'
    - The only you are going to be able to persist systematically over years and improve a rare and valuable skill is if you have a huge amount of passion for that topic.
    - Benjamin Bloom: Esteemed educational psychologist from the University of Chicago who studied "How people build up world class talent".
    - Most virtuosos did not start with an exceptional amount of skills, nor with exceptional amount of passion. The more consistent pattern which goes like - Early in life they have a serendipitous positive encounter with their field, for example: a piano teacher who was fun, because of which they had "just a little more" persistence with the practice in that very early stage of learning their craft. They practiced a little bit longer and little bit harder, which made them a little bit better and then it became a part of their identity and gave them a boost of confidence enough for them to persist a little bit harder through the next stage of practice when they got a little bit better and the gap widened a little bit and that gave them enough motivation and enough interest that they persist to the next, even harder level where they had to practice a little bit more. And over time, there is a snowball effect: Their interest and passion grew.
    - Bloom's research shows that their passion grew along with their skill. It did not exist at this magnitude in the very beginning.
    - The role of "passion" can be seen here as more of a "side-effect" than a starting point.
    - The notion that you've to identify a passion in advance doesn't have a lot of evidence to back it up.

Newport's law of 'Deep Work':
    - Focusing persistently and without distraction on a cognitively demanding and valuable task.
    - This type of work plays a crucial role.
    - The state of "cognitive strain" where you persist even though it's uncomfortable is exactly the state in which you improve at a 'cognitive skill'.
    - So, the heuristics is simple:


        heuristic /ˌhjʊ(ə)ˈrɪstɪk/, noun, plural: heuristics: a heuristic process or method, the study and use of heuristic techniques
        heuristic /ˌhjʊ(ə)ˈrɪstɪk/, adjective: enabling a person to discover or learn something for themselves.
        "A heuristic technique, often called simply a heuristic, is any approach to problem solving, learning, or discovery that employs a practical method not guaranteed to be optimal or perfect, but sufficient for the immediate goals".

        Heuristics can be mental shortcuts that ease the cognitive load of making a decision. Examples that employ heuristics include using trial and error, a rule of thumb or an educated guess.

        The opposite of "heuristic" would be "deductive". Heuristic reasoning is based on experience or probabilistic approaches that are likely to find adequate solutions. Deductive reasoning is based on provable inferences to reach a logically certain conclusion.

        Are heuristics bad?
        Because heuristics simplify difficult decisions, they help us avoid “analysis paralysis” under conditions of uncertainty that demand speed. In that way, they can improve decision-making effectiveness. But they can also lead to mistakes. Let's start by exploring the good side.
        
        conjecture /kənˈdʒɛktʃə/, noun: An opinion or conclusion formed on the basis of incomplete information.
        "conjectures about the newcomer were many and varied".
        
        Conjecture is a statement that is believed to be true but not yet proved. Example: 1) The statement "Sum of the measures of the interior angles in any triangle is 180°" is a conjecture. 2) "If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, the corresponding angles are congruent.
    - Heuristics from the aforementioned topic:
    - If you want to be cultivating a rare and valuable skill in a knowledge-worker-creative pursuit, a non-trivial fraction of your work hours have to be dedicated to "this" type of work.
    - Note: There is no way to get around that.

What can you do to "Deep Work"?
- First: Simplest Technique called "Time Blocking"
    - Instead of being "reactive" about your day, you plan it in advance.
    - Deep working isn't a natural activity and that's not something that you are gonna do spontaneously.
    - If you are not planning in advance, what you are going to and when, it is not going to show up in your schedule.
    - This is the "foundation" on which deep work makes its way into knowledge-work working schedules.

- Second: Creating an "Artifact"
    - Even if you put aside time for deep work, it doesn't mean that you're actually going to get the right cognitive strain out of that period. Because our brains have evolved to be very conservative about energy expenditure.
    - Deep work is fabulously energy intensive.
    - If you tell your brain "lets think hard about this", it will find a way to avoid hard things.
    - The solution that works well is to have an "artifact" as a "goal" for every deep work session.
    - A clearly defined outcome that forces your mind to tackle that hard things it doesn't want to.

- Third:
    - The final Technique is to understand the act of focusing itself.
    - You've to think about it like you'd think about "pull ups".
    - It's easy to understand what it is but it is harder to do a lot of it if you're not training (regularly).
    - It's about 'the systematic training of your ability to focus'.
    - Tool: Filters to turn off the filters like "leech blocked" that can help you turn off access to distracting websites.
    - You've to have an athlete's mindset to build your ability up to focus.
    - Adding "ten more minutes" to your "total amount of time you can focus" after every ten sessions is about the rate at which your ability can grow.
    - If you start with 30-minute sessions, do 10 of those successfully before you can go to 40.
    - And then, you do 10 of those before you go to 50.
    - That's about how slow it is to icrease this ability to focus.
    - And this is crucial to make this happen. 

Summary:
How do people end up loving what they do for a living?
- Well we know that "Follow your passion" sounds good but it's too simplistic.
- The more common story is they systematically build up a skill and passion grows along with the skill.
- You can't have a "good job" (or work life) until you're good at something (skills that are rare and valuable).
- And in knowledge work, deep work and the different rituals and habits that surround it is what's going to build up those skills and therefore, build this working life that you really love.
- And if you want to be successful at what you do, then do what Steve Jobs did and not what he said.
    
Ideas:
1. Don't follow your passion.
2. Be so good that they can't ignore you.
3. Go Deep.


The conjencture to the age old question "How did he ended up doing what he does" is: SKILL.

Book Suggestion: The End of Nature by Bill McKibben is the best book since Rachel Carson's Silent Spring.
