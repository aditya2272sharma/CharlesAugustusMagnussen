Charles Augustus Magnussen is a media mogul who owns several newspapers. He has powerful connections across the Western World and also ties to those in the British government, one of them being Mycroft Holmes. Magnussen is also a blackmailer and uses the information against his "assets" (which he views his victims as).Cold, calculating, and an egomaniac, Magnussen displayed a disregard for social niceties. A sociopath, Magnussen had a misanthropic view of other people, to the point of possessing a superiority complex.[1] He also displayed traits of extreme sadism and megalomania. Examples of his superiority complex were categorised by his utter disregard for human happiness, inflated sense of entitlement, narcissistic view on how other people think and behave, and even going so far as to torment his victims to get what he wanted. He relished demonstrating his power for its own sake. Sherlock Holmes considered him to be far worse than any killer, serial killer, or terrorist that he had encountered and the one man who could turn his stomach. 


Why The Vertical Takeoff Airliner Failed: The Rotodyne Story

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkJOm1V77Xg
The Fairey Rotodyne was a 1950s British compound gyroplane designed and built by Fairey Aviation and intended for commercial and military uses.[2] A development of the earlier Gyrodyne, which had established a world helicopter speed record, the Rotodyne featured a tip-jet-powered rotor that burned a mixture of fuel and compressed air bled from two wing-mounted Napier Eland turboprops. The rotor was driven for vertical takeoffs, landings and hovering, as well as low-speed translational flight and autorotated during cruise flight with all engine power applied to two propellers. 

The Jet Gyrodyne was a modification of the second prototype FB-1 Gyrodyne aircraft registered G-AJJP. The Jet Gyrodyne was built specifically to develop the pressure-jet rotor drive system and operational procedures used on the later Rotodyne.

Never have I ever imagined that 2020 would be a year full of catastrophy and some African people dancing with a coffin will be the most relatable meme.
Yes. It's the first meme in a while that gets better and more creative with each video.
Honestly, i‚Äôve seen so many memes, i‚Äôve made so many memes, but this, this one right here, we may UNIRONICALLY actually be at peak comedy right now, this is the best stuff i‚Äôve ever seen in my entire life, it‚Äôs also the only thing making me laugh through these Corona times.
I think the fact that the meme has a song strongly associated with it makes it super adaptable.
Also the dubstep drop will never get old.
Sorry but Astronomia is not dubstep
Also seems like the Chinese are making the best versions of this meme right now. (I suppose this video was probably made in Hongkong, since using keys on elevator buttons is common there.)
The pandemic has done one good thing. It's made everyone more creative. Not saying it was worth it by any means, just that at least something good came from it.

Honestly. If the virus doesn‚Äôt get ya, these tornado storms will.
Or a massive Forrest fire, or a plague or a looming economic recession, or an active volcanic eruption.
Damn Confederate generals starting fires irresponsibly.
ARE WE BURNING GEORGIA AGAIN? GET YOUR RUNNING SHOES ON BOYS WERE MARCHING TO THE SEA.
Tybee Island locals seen partying in the streets amid pandemic tornado invasion sirens
"We ain't scared! We just ordered a round of Tornadorona bombs!"
Yosemite like "lol wouldn't it by wild if.."

lol I love people from Ghana. My family had some church friends from there. Dude the parties are no joke. I've never been to a funeral but they celebrate weddings and babies big. Asian scripted gifs approves üëç
This is downright hilarious. As I thought the coffin dance couldn't get any better, it straight up evolved
The irony the meme about DEAD people is evolving.
Mutated, if you will.
Shit is mutating faster than the virus.
Lol this is a whole movie.
I‚Äôd pay to see more.
This meme is spreading faster than the Rona.
r/gifthatkeepsongiving

Imagine the song would come up in your head each time you‚Äôre moments from danger.
Like if you have a choice to walk or take a cab, starting to walk makes the song start in your head bc you could potentially get mugged and killed.
Edit: this is some top tier variation of the meme.

His nostril flares were so big. But awesome video.
Right? I thought no one was gonna mention his soul-consuming black hole nostrils...

It's a wristwatch that could only have belonged to someone like Pablo Escobar: a solid gold Rolex encrusted with hundreds of fine diamonds. With a sale value estimated at $70,000 (¬£43,000), it went to the highest bidder at Colombia's first warehouse auction of narco-goods for the equivalent of just $8,500 (¬£5,300).
A knock-off Rolex that was owned by a Farc rebel commander known as Ra√∫l Reyes, meanwhile, went for three times its street price.

An Answer to a Monetary Riddle
By David Henderson

Last quarter, I received the following ‚Äúriddle‚Äù from a student in my class:

    It‚Äôs a slow day in some little town‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
    The sun is hot‚Ä¶.the streets are deserted.
    Times are tough, everybody is in debt, and everybody lives on credit.

    On this particular day a rich tourist from back west is driving thru town.
    He stops at the motel and lays a $100 bill on the desk saying he wants to inspect the rooms upstairs in order to pick one to spend the night.
    As soon as the man walks upstairs, the owner grabs the bill and runs next door to pay his debt to the butcher.
    The butcher takes the $100 and runs down the street to retire his debt to the pig farmer.
    The pig farmer takes the $100 and heads off to pay his bill at the feed store.

    The guy at the Farmer‚Äôs Co-op takes the $100 and runs to pay his debt to the local prostitute, who has also been facing hard times and has had to offer her services on credit.
    She, in a flash rushes to the motel and pays off her room bill with the motel owner.
    The motel proprietor now places the $100 back on the counter so the rich traveler will not suspect anything.

    At that moment the traveler comes down the stairs, picks up the $100 bill, states that the rooms are not satisfactory, pockets the money & leaves.

    NOW,‚Ä¶ no one produced anything‚Ä¶and no one earned anything‚Ä¶however the whole town is out of debt and is looking to the future with much optimism.

Here‚Äôs monetary economist Jeffrey Rogers Hummel‚Äôs answer:

There are several ways to think about this intriguing example. But they all must recognize that these transactions have made no change in any of the parties‚Äô NET wealth. True, at the beginning each resident has a $100 liability. But each also has an offsetting financial asset of $100. At the end, they all have neither. So the $100 bill acts as a clearing mechanism.

If you want to think of the town as a distinct economy, then the rich tourist has temporarily increased the town‚Äôs money stock by $100. In effect, he has made a short-term loan of a new $100 bill, increasing liquidity. The $100 provides the residents with a medium of exchange that allows them to clear their offsetting debts.

Or if you broaden the economy to include the rich tourist, his short-term loan has provided liquidity through increasing the transactions velocity of money. If the rich tourist hadn‚Äôt provided the loan, any of the residents could have accomplished the same result by borrowing $100 cash from someone else. No new final goods and services were produced (they had been produced already). But borrowing from the tourist may have cost less interest (zero percent) than otherwise. (I‚Äôm ignoring the possible complication that the hotel owner only gets a zero-percent loan by embezzling: using the tourist‚Äôs deposit without permission.)

Either way, the $100 cash would have been unnecessary if the residents had a central clearinghouse. The fact that the hotel owner seems to know that the $100 bill will come back quickly suggests they already had everything necessary for an informal clearing, and didn‚Äôt need the bill in the first place. The hotel owner could have gone to each party in succession, offering to take on their debt if they cancelled his.

Nonetheless, the example illustrates Mises‚Äôs point that increases in the efficiency of the clearing system reduce the demand for (increase the velocity of) money. A clearing system is an alternative way of providing medium of exchange services. In fact, in my classes I use a similar example with fewer parties to illustrate the nature and benefits of a clearing system. At the limit, a perfectly efficient clearing system would be an all-encompassing network of computerized barter making money completely unnecessary. So your student‚Äôs intuition is partly right. What the tourist‚Äôs short-term loan has produced is monetary services.
